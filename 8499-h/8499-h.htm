      PUBLISHER'S NOTE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Since the accompanying biographical note, which aims solely at outlining
      the principal events of Strindberg's life up to 1912, was put in type, the
      news of his death from cancer, at Stockholm on May 14, 1912, has been
      reported.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the plays included in the present volume, "The Father" and "Countess
      Julie" are representative of Strindberg's high water mark in dramatic
      technique and have successfully maintained their claim to a permanent
      place, not only in dramatic literature, but, as acting plays.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Stronger," than which no better example of Strindberg's uncanny power
      for analysis of the female mind exists, while essentially a chamber play,
      is from time to time presented at the theatre, and affords a splendid test
      of the dramatic ability of the actors, only one of whom speaks. The author
      has boldly thrown on the other the burden of maintaining her share in the
      development of the action by pantomime, facial expression, and an
      occasional laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Outlaw," although inferior in construction to the others, is still
      played with success and is full of dignity and atmosphere. The important
      part it played in promoting the fortunes of the author lends to it an
      added interest which fully justifies its inclusion in this volume.

      BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "I tell you, you must have chaos in you, if you would give
     birth to a dancing star."&mdash;Nietzsche.
</pre>
    <p>
      In Stockholm, living almost as a recluse, August Strindberg is dreaming
      life away. The dancing stars, sprung from the chaos of his being, shine
      with an ever-increasing refulgence from the high-arched dome of dramatic
      literature, but he no longer adds to their number. The constellation of
      the Lion of the North is complete.
    </p>
    <p>
      At sixty-three, worn by the emotional intensity of a life, into which has
      been crowded the stress and storm of a universe, he sits at his desk,
      every day transcribing to his diary a record of those mystical forces
      which he says regulate his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before him lies a crucifix, Hardly as a symbol of sectarian faith, for
      Strindberg is a Swedenborgian, but a fitting accompaniment, nevertheless,
      to a state of mind which he expresses in saying "One gets more and more
      humble the longer one lives, and in the shadow of death many things look
      different." A softer light beams from those blue eyes, which, under that
      tossing crown of tawny hair flung high from a speaking forehead, in times
      past flashed defiance at every opposition. For him the fierce, unyielding,
      never-ceasing, ever-pressing strife of mind and unrest of life is passing,
      an eddy in the tide has borne him into quieter waters, and if the hum of
      the world reaches his solitude, it no longer rouses him to headlong
      action.
    </p>
    <p>
      Secure in his position as the foremost man of letters Sweden has produced
      in modern times, the last representative of that distinguished group of
      Scandinavian writers which included Ibsen, Bjornson and Brandes, with a
      Continental reputation surpassing that of any one of them, Strindberg well
      may be entitled to dream of the past.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day when in the evolution of the drama Strindberg's technique shall
      have served its purpose and like Ibsen's, be forced to give way before the
      advance of younger artists, when his most radical views shall have become
      the commonplaces of pseudo-culture, the scientific psychologist will take
      the man in hand and, from the minute record of his life, emotions,
      thoughts, fancies, speculations and nightmares, which he has embodied in
      autobiographical novels and that most remarkable perhaps of all his
      creations, abysmal in its pessimism, "The Inferno," will be drawn a true
      conception of the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      That the individual will prove quite as interesting a study as his
      literary work, even the briefest outline of Strindberg's life will
      suggest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lack of harmony in his soul that has permeated his life and work with
      theses and antitheses Strindberg tries to explain through heredity, a by
      no means satisfying or complete solution for the motivation of his
      frequently unusual conduct and exceptional temperamental qualities, which
      the abnormal psychologist is in the habit of associating with that not
      inconsiderable group of cases in which the emotional and temperamental
      characteristics of the opposite sex are dominant in the individual. His
      ancestry has been traced back to the sixteenth century, when his father's
      family was of the titled aristocracy, later, generation after generation,
      becoming churchmen, although Strindberg's father, Carl Oscar, undertook a
      commercial career. His mother, Ulrica Eleanora Norling, was the daughter
      of a poor tailor, whom Strindberg's father first met as a waitress in a
      hotel, and, falling in love with her, married, after she had borne him
      three children.
    </p>
    <p>
      August, christened Johann August, the fourth child, was born at Stockholm,
      January 22, 1849, soon after his father had become a bankrupt. There was
      little light or cheer in the boy's home; the misfortune that overtook the
      family at the time of August's birth always hung over them like a dark
      cloud; the mother became nervous and worn from the twelve child-births she
      survived, the father serious and reserved. The children were brought up
      strictly and as August was no favorite, loneliness and hostility filled
      even his earliest years.
    </p>
    <p>
      His first school days were spent among boys of the better class, who
      turned up their noses at his leather breeches and heavy boots. He was
      taken away from that school and sent where there was a lower class of
      boys, whose leader he soon became, but in his studies he was far from
      precocious, though not dull.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he grew up the family fortunes bettered, and he attended a private
      school patronized by cultivated and wealthy people. Mixing so with both
      classes meant much in the development of the youth, and he began to
      realize that he belonged to both and neither, felt homeless, torn in his
      sympathies and antipathies, plebian and aristocratic at the same time. In
      his thirteenth year, his mother died, a loss for which his father was
      apparently soon consoled, as in less than a year he married his
      housekeeper. This was another blow to the boy, for he disliked the woman,
      and there was soon war between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      At fifteen he fell in love with it woman of thirty of very religious
      character, and its this was a period of fervent belief with the youth
      himself, she became an influence in his life for Home time, but one day a
      young comrade asked him to luncheon at a cafe, and for the first time
      Strindberg partook of schnaps and ale with a hearty meal. This little
      luncheon was the event which broke up the melancholy introspection of his
      youth and stirred him to activity.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went to Upsala University for one term and then left, partly on account
      of the lack of funds for books, and partly because the slow, pedantic
      methods of learning were distasteful to his restless, active nature. He
      then became a school teacher; next interested in medical science, which he
      studied energetically, until the realities of suffering drove him from it.
      About this time, the same time, by the way, that Ibsen's "The League of
      Youth" was being hissed down at Christiana, the creative artist in
      Strindberg began to stir, and after six months more of turmoil of soul, he
      turned to the stage as a possible solution, making his debut at the
      Dramatiska Theatre in 1869 in Bjornson's "Mary Stuart," in the part of a
      lord with one line to speak. After two months of no advancement he found
      courage to ask to be heard in one of the classical roles he had been
      studying.
    </p>
    <p>
      The director, tired from a long rehearsal, reluctantly consented to listen
      to him, likewise, the bored company of actors. Strindberg went on "to do
      or die," and was soon shouting like a revivalist, and made such it bad
      impression that he was advised to go to the dramatic school to study. He
      went home disgusted and heartsick, and, determined to take his life,
      swallowed an opium pill which he had long been keeping for that purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, it was not sufficiently powerful, and, a friend coming to see
      him, he was persuaded to go out, and together they drowned his chagrin in
      an evening at it café.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day after was a memorable one, for it was Strindberg's birthday as a
      dramatist. He was lying on a sofa at home, his body still hot from the
      shame of his defeat&mdash;and wine, trying to figure out how he could
      persuade his stepmother to effect a reconciliation between him and his
      father. He saw the scenes played as clearly as though on a stage, and with
      his brain working at high pressure, in two hours had the scheme for two
      acts of a comedy worked out. In four days it was finished&mdash;Strindberg's
      first play! It was refused production, but he was complimented, and felt
      that his honor was saved.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fever of writing took possession of him and within two months he had
      finished two comedies, and a tragedy in verse called "Hermione," which was
      later produced. Giving so much promise as a dramatist he was persuaded to
      leave the stage and, unwilling of spirit, returned to Upsala in the spring
      of 1870, as he was advised that he would never be recognized as a writer
      unless he had secured is university degree. The means with which to
      continue his studies were derived from the two hundred crowns left him by
      his mother, which he now forced his father to allow him to use. Despite
      this, however, his fortunes often ran to the lowest ebb.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day Strindberg announced that he had a one act play called "In Rome"
      to read to the "Runa" (Song) Club, a group of six students whom he had
      gotten together, and which was devoted exclusively to the reading of the
      poetry of its members. The play, based upon an incident in the life of
      Thorvaldsen, was received enthusiastically by the "Runa," and the rest of
      the night was spent in high talk of Strindberg's future over a champagne
      supper in his honor given by one of the well-to-do members. These days of
      homage and appreciation from this student group Strindberg cherishes as
      the happiest time in his life, but notwithstanding their worshipful
      attitude, he himself was full of doubts and misgivings about his
      abilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of these friends sent the manuscript of "In Rome" to the Dramatiska
      Theatre at Stockholm, where it was accepted and produced anonymously in
      August of the same year, 1870. Strindberg was present at the premiere and
      although it was well received, to him it was all a fine occasion&mdash;except
      the play! He was ashamed of his self-confession in it and fled before the
      final curtain. He soon finished another play, "The Outlaw," which is
      included in the present volume. In this drama, which retains a high place
      among his plays, Strindberg shows for the first time his lion's claw and
      in it began to speak with his own voice. It was accepted by the Court
      Theatre at Stockholm for production during the next autumn, that of 1871.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the close of the summer, after a violent quarrel with his father, he
      returned to the University in the hope of finding help from his comrades.
      Arrived at Upsala, with just one crown, he found that many of his old and
      more prosperous friends were no longer there. Times were harder than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      But at last a gleam of hope came with the news that "The Outlaw" was
      actually to be produced. And his wildest dreams were then realized, for,
      despite the unappreciative attitude of the critics toward this splendid
      Viking piece, the King, Carl XV, after seeing the play, commanded
      Strindberg to appear before him. Strindberg regarded the summons as the
      perpetration of a practical joke, and only obeyed it after making sure by
      telegraph that it was not a hoax.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strindberg tells of the kindly old king standing with a big pipe in his
      hand as the young author strode between chamberlains and other court
      dignitaries into the royal presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king, a grandson of Napoleon's marshal Bernadotte, and as a Frenchman
      on the throne of Sweden, diplomatic enough to desire at least the
      appearance of being more Swedish than the Swedes, spoke of the pleasure
      the ancient Viking spirit of "The Outlaw" had given him, and, after
      talking genially for some time, said, "You are the son of Strindberg, the
      steamship agent, I believe and so, of course, are not in need."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite the reverse," Strindberg replied, explaining that his father no
      longer gave him the meager help in his university course, which he had
      formerly done.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How much can you get along on per annum until you graduate?" asked the
      king.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strindberg was unable to say in a moment. "I'm rather short of coin
      myself," said the king quite frankly, "but do you think you could manage
      on eight hundred riksdaler a year?" Strindberg was overwhelmed by such
      munificence, and the interview was concluded by his introduction to the
      court treasurer, from whom he received his first quarter's allowance of
      two hundred crowns.
    </p>
    <p>
      Full of thankfulness for this unexpected turn of fate, the young dramatist
      returned to Upsala. For once he appeared satisfied with his lot, and took
      up his studies with more earnestness than ever. The year 1871 closed
      brilliantly for the young writer, for in addition to the kingly favor be
      received honorable mention from the Swedish Academy for his Greek drama
      "Hermione." The following year, 1872, life at the university again began
      to pall on his restless mind, and he took to painting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then followed a serious disagreement with one of the professors, so that
      when he received word from the court treasurer that it was uncertain
      whether his stipend could be continued on account of the death of the
      king, he decided to leave the University for good. At a farewell banquet
      in his honor, he expressed his appreciation of all he had received from
      his student friends, saying, "A personality does not develop from itself,
      but out of each soul it comes in contact with, it sucks a drop, just as
      the bee gathers its honey from a million flowers giving it forth
      eventually as its own."
    </p>
    <p>
      Strindberg went to Stockholm to become a literateur and, if possible, a
      creative artist. He gleaned a living from newspaper work for a few months,
      but in the summer went to a fishing village on a remote island in Bothnia
      Bay where, in his twenty-third year, he wrote his great historical drama,
      "Master Olof." Breaking away from traditions and making flesh and blood
      creations instead of historical skeletons in this play, it was refused by
      all the managers of the theatres, who assured Strindberg that the public
      would not tolerate any such unfamiliar methods. Strindberg protested, and
      defended and tried to elucidate his realistic handling of the almost
      sacred historical personages, but in vain, for "Master Olof" was not
      produced until seven years later, when it was put on at the Swedish
      Theatre at Stockholm in 1880, the year Ibsen was writing "Ghosts" at
      Sorrento.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1874, after a year or two of unsuccessful effort to make a living in
      various employments, he became assistant at the Court library, which was
      indeed a haven of refuge, a position providing both leisure for study and
      an assured income. Finding in the library some Chinese parchments which
      had not been catalogued; he plunged into the study of that language. A
      treatise which he wrote on the subject won him medals from various learned
      societies at home, as well as recognition from the French Institute. This
      success induced the many other treatises that followed, for which he
      received a variety of decorations, and along with the honors nearly
      brought upon himself "a salubrious idiocy," to use his own phrase.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then something happened that stirred the old higher voice in him,&mdash;he
      fell in love. He had been invited through a woman friend to go to the home
      of Baron Wrangel, where his name as an author was esteemed. He refused the
      invitation, but the next day, walking in the city streets with this same
      woman friend, they encountered the Baroness Wrangel to whom Strindberg was
      introduced. The Baroness asked him once more to come. He promised to do
      so, and they separated. As Strindberg's friend went into a shop, he turned
      to look down the street; noting the beautiful lines of the disappearing
      figure of the Baroness, noting, too, a stray lock of her golden hair, that
      had escaped from her veil, and played against the white ruching at her
      throat. He gazed after her long, in fact, until she disappeared in the
      crowded street. From that moment he was not a free man. The friendship
      which followed resulted in the divorce of the Baroness from her husband
      and her marriage to Strindberg, December 30, 1877, when he was
      twenty-eight years old. At last Strindberg had someone to love, to take
      care of, to worship. This experience of happiness, so strange to him,
      revived the creative impulse.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following year, 1878, "Master Olof" was finally accepted for
      publication, and won immediate praise and appreciation. This, to his mind,
      belated success, roused in Strindberg a smoldering resentment, which lack
      of confidence and authority of position had heretofore caused him to
      repress. He broke out with a burning satire, in novel form, called "The
      Red Room," the motto of which he made Voltaire's words "Rien n'est si
      désagréable que s'etre pendu obscurément."
    </p>
    <p>
      Hardly more than mention can be made of the important work of this
      dramatist, poet, novelist, historian, scientist and philosopher. In 1888
      he left Sweden, as the atmosphere there had become too disagreeable for
      him through controversy after controversy in which lie became involved. He
      joined a group of painters and writers of all nationalities in it little
      village in France. There he wrote "La France," setting forth the relations
      between France and Sweden in olden times. This was published in Paris and
      the French government, tendered him the decoration of the legion of honor
      which, however, he refused very politely, explaining that he never wore a
      frock coat! The episode ends amusingly with the publisher, a Swede,
      receiving the decoration instead. In 1884 the first volume of his famous
      short stories, called "Marriages" appeared. It was aimed at the cult that
      had sprung up from Ibsen's "A Doll's House," which was threatening the
      peace of all households. A few days after the publication of "Marriages"
      the first edition was literally swallowed up. As the book dealt frankly
      with the physical facts of sex relations, it was confiscated by the
      Swedish government a month after its publication, and Strindberg was
      obliged to go to Stockholm to defend his cause in the courts, which he
      won, and in another month "Marriages" was again on the market.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next year, 1885, his "Real Utopias" was written in Switzerland, an
      attack, in the form of four short stories, on over-civilization, which won
      him much applause in Germany. He went to Italy as a special correspondent
      for the "Daily News" of Stockholm.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1886 the much anticipated second volume of "Marriages" appeared. These
      were the short stories, satisfying to the simplest as well as to the most
      discriminating minds, that attracted Nietzsche's attention to Strindberg.
      A correspondence sprung up between the two men, referring to which in a
      letter to Peter Gast, Nietzsche said, "Strindberg has written to me, and
      for the first time I sense an answering note of universality." The mutual
      admiration and intellectual sympathies of these two conspicuous creative
      geniuses has led a number of critics, including Edmund Gosse, into the
      error of attributing to Nietzsche a dominating influence over Strindberg.
      It should be remembered, however, the "Countess Julie" and "The Father,"
      which are cited its the most obvious examples of that supposed influence,
      were completed before Strindberg's acquaintance with Nietzsche's
      philosophy, and that among others, the late John Davidson, is also charged
      with having drawn largely from Nietzsche. The fact is, that, during the
      last quarter of the nineteenth century, the most original thinkers of many
      countries were quite independently, though less clearly, evolving the same
      philosophic principals that the master mind of Nietzsche was radiating in
      the almost blinding flashes of his genius.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came the period during which Strindberg attained the highest peaks of
      his work, the years 1886-90, with his autobiography, "The Servant Woman's
      Son," the tragedies, "The Father," and "Countess Julie," the comedies,
      "Comrades," and "The Stronger," and the tragi-comedies, "The Creditors"
      and "Simoon." Of these, "The Father" and "Countess Julie" soon made
      Strindberg's name known and honored throughout Europe, except in his home
      country.
    </p>
    <p>
      In "The Father" perhaps his biggest vision is felt. It was published in
      French soon after it appeared in Sweden, with an introduction by Zola in
      which he says, "To be brief, you have written a mighty and captivating
      work. It is one of the few dramas that have had the power to stir me to
      the depths."
    </p>
    <p>
      Of his choice of theme in "Countess Julie," Strindberg says: "When I took
      this motive from life, as it was related to me a few years ago, it made a
      strong impression on me. I found it suitable for tragedy, and it still
      makes a sorrowful impression on me to see an individual to whom happiness
      has been allotted go under, much more, to see a line become extinct." And
      in defence of his realism he has said further in his preface to "Countess
      Julie": "The theatre has for a long time seemed to me the Biblia pauperum
      in the fine arts, a bible with pictures for those who can neither read nor
      write, and the dramatist is the revivalist, and the revivalist dishes tap
      the ideas of the day in popular form, so popular that the middle class, of
      whom the bulk of theatre-goers is comprised, can without burdening their
      brains understand what it is all about. The theatre therefore has always
      been a grammar school for the young, the half-educated, and women, who
      still possess the primitive power of being able to delude themselves and
      of allowing themselves to be deluded, that is to say, receive illusions
      and accept suggestions from the dramatist. *** Some people have accused my
      tragedy, 'The Father' of being too sad, as though one desired a merry
      tragedy. People call authoritatively for the 'Joy of Life' and theatrical
      managers call for farces, as though the Joy of Life lay in being foolish,
      and in describing people who each and every one are suffering from St.
      Vitus' dance or idiocy. I find the joy of life in the powerful, terrible
      struggles of life; and the capability of experiencing something, of
      learning something, is a pleasure to me. And therefore I have chosen an
      unusual but instructive subject; in other words, an exception, but a great
      exception, that will strengthen the rules which offend the apostle of the
      commonplace. What will further create antipathy in some, is the fact that
      my plan of action is not simple, and that there is not one view alone to
      be taken of it. An event in life&mdash;and that is rather a new discovery&mdash;is
      usually occasioned by a series of more or less deep-seated motifs, but the
      spectator generally chooses that one which his power of judgment finds
      simplest to grasp, or that his gift of judgment considers the most
      honorable. For example, someone commits suicide: 'Bad business!' says the
      citizen; 'Unhappy love!' says the woman; 'Sickness!' says the sick man;
      'Disappointed hopes?' the bankrupt. But it may be that none of these
      reasons is the real one, and that the dead man hid the real one by
      pretending another that would throw the most favorable light on his
      memory. *** In the following drama ('Julie') I have not sought to do
      anything new, because that cannot be done, but only to modernize the form
      according to the requirements I have considered present-day people
      require."
    </p>
    <p>
      Following the mighty output, of those years, in 1891 Strindberg went out:
      to the islands where he had lived years before, and led a hermit's life.
      Many of his romantic plays were written there, and much of his time was
      spent at painting.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1892 he was divorced from his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a few months Strindberg went to Berlin, where he was received with
      all honors by literary Germany. Richard Dehmel, one of their foremost
      minstrels, celebrated the event by a poem called "An Immortal,&mdash;To
      Germany's Guest." In the shop windows his picture hung alongside that of
      Bismarck, and at the theatres his plays were being produced. About this
      time he heard of the commotion that "Countess Julie" had created in Paris,
      where it had been produced by Antoine. During these victorious times
      Strindberg met a young Austrian writer, Frida Uhl, to whom he was married
      in April 1898. Although the literary giant of the hour, he was
      nevertheless in very straightened pecuniary circumstances, which led to
      his allowing the publication of "A Fool's Confession," written in French,
      and later, with out his permission or knowledge, issued in German and
      Swedish, which entangled him in a lawsuit, as the subject matter contained
      much of his marital miseries. Interest in chemistry had long been stirring
      in Strindberg's mind; it now began to deepen. About this time also he
      passed through that religious crisis which swept artistic Europe, awakened
      nearly a century after his death by that Swedenborgian poet and artist,
      William Blake. To this period belongs "To Damascus," a play of deepest
      soul probing, which was not finished however until 1904.
    </p>
    <p>
      Going to Paris in the fall of 1894, to pursue chemical research most
      seriously, he ran into his own success at the theatres there. "The
      Creditors" had been produced and Strindberg was induced to undertake the
      direction of "The Father" at the Theatre de l'Oeuvre, where it was a
      tremendous success. A Norwegian correspondent was forced to send word home
      that with "The Father" Strindberg had overreached Ibsen in Paris, because
      what it had never been possible to do with an Ibsen play, have a run in
      Paris, they were now doing with Strindberg. At the same time the Theâtre
      des Ecaliers put on "The Link," the Odean produced "The Secret of the
      Guild," and the Chat Noir "The Kings of Heaven," and translations of his
      novels were running in French periodicals. But Strindberg turned his back
      on all this success and shut himself up in his laboratory to delve into
      chemistry. This he did with such earnestness that with his discovery of
      Swedenborg his experimentations and speculations reduced him to a
      condition of mind that unfitted him for any kind of companionship, so that
      when his wife left him to go to their child who was ill and far away, he
      welcomed the complete freedom. Strindberg says of their parting at the
      railway station that although they smiled and waved to each other as they
      called out "Auf wiedersehen" they both knew that they were saying good bye
      forever, which proved to be true, as they were divorced a year later. In
      1896 he returned to Sweden so broken in health through his tremendous
      wrestling with the riddle of life that he went into the sanitorium of his
      friend, Dr. Aliasson at Wstad. After two months he was sufficiently
      restored to go to Austria, at the invitation of his divorced wife's
      family, to see his child. Then back to Sweden, to Lund, a university town,
      where he lived solely to absorb Swedenborg. By May of that year he was
      able to go to work on "The Inferno," that record of a soul's nightmare,
      which in all probability will remain unique in the history of literature.
      Then came the writing of the great historical dramas, then the
      realistically symbolic plays of Swedenborgian spirit, of which "Easter" is
      representative, and the most popular.
    </p>
    <p>
      When "Easter" was produced in Stockholm a young Norwegian, Harriet Bosse,
      played Eleanora, the psychic, and in 1901 this young actress became
      Strindberg's wife. This third marriage ended in divorce three years later.
      In 1906, the actor manager, August Folk, produced "Countess Julie" in
      Stockholm, seventeen years after it had been written. To Strindberg's
      amazement, it won such tremendous attention that the other theatres became
      deserted. In consequence of this success an intimate theatre was founded
      for the production of none but Strindberg's plays.
    </p>
    <p>
      How he is estimated today in his own country may be judged by the
      following extract from an article which appeared in a recent issue of the
      leading periodical of Stockholm:
    </p>
    <p>
      "For over thirty years he has dissected us from every point of view;
      during that time his name has always been conspicuous in every book-shop
      window and his books gradually push out the others from our shelves; every
      night his plays are produced at the theatres; every conversation turns on
      him, and his is the name the pigmies quarrel over daily; the cry is heard
      that he has become hysterical, sentimental, out of his mind, but the next
      one knows, he is robustness itself, and enduring beyond belief, despite
      great need, enmity, sorrow. One hour one is angry over some extravagance
      which he has allowed himself, the next captivated by one of his plays,
      stirred, melted, strengthened and uplifted by his sublime genius."

      [The sitting room at the Captain's. There is a door a little to the right
      at the back. In the middle of the room, a large, round table strewn with
      newspapers and magazines. To right a leather-covered sofa and table. In
      the right-hand corner a private door. At left there is a door leading to
      the inner room and a desk with a clock on it. Gamebags, guns and other
      arms hang on the walls. Army coats hang near door at back. On the large
      table stands a lighted lamp.]
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN [rings, an orderly comes in.]
    </p>
    <p>
      ORDERLY. Yes, Captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Is Nöjd out there?
    </p>
    <p>
      ORDERLY. He is waiting for orders in the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. In the kitchen again, is he? Send him in at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      ORDERLY. Yes, Captain. [Goes.]
    </p>
    <p>
      PASTOR. What's the matter now?
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Oh the rascal has been cutting up with the servant-girl again;
      he's certainly a bad lot.
    </p>
    <p>
      PASTOR. Why, Nöjd got into the same trouble year before last, didn't he?
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Yes, you remember? Won't you be good enough to give him a
      friendly talking to and perhaps you can make some impression on him. I've
      sworn at him and flogged him, too, but it hasn't had the least effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      PASTOR. And so you want me to preach to him? What effect do you suppose
      the word of God will have on a rough trooper?
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Well, it certainly has no effect on me.
    </p>
    <p>
      PASTOR. I know that well enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Try it on him, anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Nöjd comes in.]
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. What have you been up to now, Nöjd?
    </p>
    <p>
      NÖJD. God save you, Captain, but I couldn't talk about it with the Pastor
      here.
    </p>
    <p>
      PASTOR. Don't be afraid of me, my boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. You had better confess or you know what will happen.
    </p>
    <p>
      NÖJD. Well, you see it was like this; we were at a dance at Gabriel's, and
      then&mdash;then Ludwig said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. What has Ludwig got to do with it? Stick to the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      NÖJD. Yes, and Emma said "Let's go into the barn&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN.&mdash;Oh, so it was Emma who led you astray, was it?
    </p>
    <p>
      NÖJD. Well, not far from it. You know that unless the girl is willing
      nothing ever happens.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Never mind all that: Are you the father of the child or not?
    </p>
    <p>
      NÖJD. Who knows?
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. What's that? Don't you know?
    </p>
    <p>
      NÖJD. Why no&mdash;that is, you can never be sure.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Weren't you the only one?
    </p>
    <p>
      NÖJD. Yes, that time, but you can't be sure for all that.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Are you trying to put the blame on Ludwig? Is that what you are
      up to?
    </p>
    <p>
      NÖJD. Well, you see it isn't easy to know who is to blame.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Yes, but you told Emma you would marry her.
    </p>
    <p>
      NÖJD. Oh, a fellow's always got to say that&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN [to Pastor.] This is terrible, isn't it?
    </p>
    <p>
      PASTOR. It's the old story over again. See here, Nöjd, you surely ought to
      know whether you are the father or not?
    </p>
    <p>
      NÖJD. Well, of course I was mixed up with the girl&mdash;but you know
      yourself, Pastor, that it needn't amount to anything for all that.
    </p>
    <p>
      PASTOR. Look here, my lad, we are talking about you now. Surely you won't
      leave the girl alone with the child. I suppose we can't compel you to
      marry her, but you should provide for the child&mdash;that you shall do!
    </p>
    <p>
      NÖJD. Well, then, so must Ludwig, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Then the case must go to the courts. I cannot ferret out the
      truth of all this, nor is it to my liking. So now be off.
    </p>
    <p>
      PASTOR. One moment, Nöjd. H'm&mdash;don't you think it dishonorable to
      leave a girl destitute like that with her child? Don't you think so? Don't
      you see that such conduct&mdash; &mdash; &mdash;h'm&mdash; &mdash;h'm&mdash;
      &mdash; &mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      NÖJD. Yes, if I only knew for sure that I was father of the child, but you
      can't be sure of that, Pastor, and I don't see much fun slaving all your
      life for another man's child. Surely you, Pastor, and the Captain can
      understand for yourselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Be off.
    </p>
    <p>
      NÖJD. God save you, Captain. [Goes.]
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. But keep out of the kitchen, you rascal! [To Pastor.] Now, why
      didn't you get after him?
    </p>
    <p>
      PASTOR. What do you mean?
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Why, you only sat and mumbled something or other.
    </p>
    <p>
      PASTOR. To tell the truth I really don't know what to say. It is a pity
      about the girl, yes, and a pity about the lad, too. For think if he were
      not the father. The girl can nurse the child for four months at the
      orphanage, and then it will be permanently provided for, but it will be
      different for him. The girl can get a good place afterwards in some
      respectable family, but the lad's future may be ruined if he is dismissed
      from the regiment.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Upon my soul I should like to be in the magistrate's shoes and
      judge this case. The lad is probably not innocent, one can't be sure, but
      we do know that the girl is guilty, if there is any guilt in the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      PASTOR. Well, well, I judge no one. But what were we talking about when
      this stupid business interrupted us? It was about Bertha and her
      confirmation, wasn't it?
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Yes, but it was certainly not in particular about her
      confirmation but about her whole welfare. This house is full of women who
      all want to have their say about my child. My mother-in-law wants to make
      a Spiritualist of her. Laura wants her to be an artist; the governess
      wants her to be a Methodist, old Margret a Baptist, and the servant-girls
      want her to join the Salvation Army! It won't do to try to make a soul in
      patches like that. I, who have the chief right to try to form her
      character, am constantly opposed in my efforts. And that's why I have
      decided to send her away from home.
    </p>
    <p>
      PASTOR. You have too many women trying to run this house.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. You're right! It's like going into a cage full of tigers, and if
      I didn't hold a red-hot iron under their noses they would tear me to
      pieces any moment. And you laugh, you rascal! Wasn't it enough that I
      married your sister, without your palming off your old stepmother on me?
    </p>
    <p>
      PASTOR. But, good heavens, one can't have stepmothers in one's own house!
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. No, you think it is better to have mothers-in-law in some one
      else's house!
    </p>
    <p>
      PASTOR. Oh well, we all have some burden in life.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. But mine is certainly too heavy. I have my old nurse into the
      bargain, who treats me as if I ought still to wear a bib. She is a good
      old soul, to be sure, and she must not be dragged into such talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      PASTOR. You must keep a tight rein on the women folks. You let them run
      things too much.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Now will you please inform me how I'm to keep order among the
      women folk?
    </p>
    <p>
      PASTOR. Laura was brought up with a firm hand, but although she is my own
      sister, I must admit she <i>was</i> pretty troublesome.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Laura certainly has her faults, but with her it isn't so serious.
    </p>
    <p>
      PASTOR. Oh, speak out&mdash;I know her.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. She was brought up with romantic ideas, and it has been hard for
      her to find herself, but she is my wife&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      PASTOR And because she is your wife she is the best of wives? No, my dear
      fellow, it is she who really wears on you most.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Well, anyway, the whole house is topsy-turvy. Laura won't let
      Bertha leave her, and I can't allow her to remain in this bedlam.
    </p>
    <p>
      PASTOR. Oh, so Laura won't? Well, then, I'm afraid you are in for trouble.
      When she was a child if she set her mind on anything she used to play dead
      dog till she got it, and then likely as not she would give it back,
      explaining that it wasn't the thing she wanted, but having her own way.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. So she was like that even then? H'm&mdash;she really gets into
      such a passion sometimes that I am anxious about her and afraid she is
      ill.
    </p>
    <p>
      PASTOR. But what do you want to do with Bertha that is so unpardonable?
      Can't you compromise?
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. You mustn't think I want to make a prodigy of her or an image of
      myself. I don't want to be it procurer for my daughter and educate her
      exclusively for matrimony, for then if she were left unmarried she might
      have bitter days. On the other hand, I don't want to influence her toward
      a career that requires a long course of training which would be entirely
      thrown away if she should marry.
    </p>
    <p>
      PASTOR. What do you want, then?
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. I want her to be it teacher. If she remains unmarried she will be
      able to support herself, and at any rate she wouldn't be any worse off
      than the poor schoolmasters who have to share their salaries with a
      family. If she marries she can use her knowledge in the education of her
      children. Am I right?
    </p>
    <p>
      PASTOR. Quite right. But, on the other hand, hasn't she shown such talent
      for painting that it would be a great pity to crush it?
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. No! I have shown her sketches to an eminent painter, and he says
      they are only the kind of thing that can be learned at schools. But then a
      young fop came here in the summer who, of course, understands the matter
      much better, and he declared that she had colossal genius, and so that
      settled it to Laura's satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      PASTOR. Was he quite taken with Bertha?
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. That goes without saying.
    </p>
    <p>
      PASTOR. Then God help you, old man, for in that case I see no hope. This
      is pretty bad&mdash;and, of course, Laura has her supporters&mdash;in
      there?
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Yes, you may be sure of that; the whole house is already up in
      arms, and, between ourselves, it is not exactly a noble conflict that is
      being waged from that quarter.
    </p>
    <p>
      PASTOR. Don't you think I know that?
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. You do?
    </p>
    <p>
      PASTOR. I do.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. But the worst of it is, it strikes me that Bertha's future is
      being decided from spiteful motives. They hint that men better be careful,
      because women can do this or that now-a-days. All day long, incessantly,
      it is a conflict between man and woman. Are you going? No, stay for
      supper. I have no special inducements to offer, but do stay. You know I am
      expecting the new doctor. Have you seen him?
    </p>
    <p>
      PASTOR. I caught a glimpse of him as I came along. He looked pleasant, and
      reliable.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. That's good. Do you think it possible he may become my ally?
    </p>
    <p>
      PASTOR. Who can tell? It depends on how much he has been among women.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. But won't you really stay?
    </p>
    <p>
      PASTOR. No thanks, my dear fellow; I promised to be home for supper, and
      the wife gets uneasy if I am late.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Uneasy? Angry, you mean. Well, as you will. Let me help you with
      your coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      PASTOR. It's certainly pretty cold tonight. Thanks. You must take care of
      your health, Adolf, you seem rather nervous.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Nervous?
    </p>
    <p>
      PASTOR. Yes, you are not, really very well.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Has Laura put that into your head? She has treated me for the
      last twenty years as if I were at the point of death.
    </p>
    <p>
      PASTOR. Laura? No, but you make me uneasy about you. Take care of yourself&mdash;that's
      my advice! Good-bye, old man; but didn't you want to talk about the
      confirmation?
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Not at all! I assure you that matter will have to take its course
      in the ordinary way at the cost of the clerical conscience for I am
      neither a believer nor a martyr.
    </p>
    <p>
      PASTOR. Good-bye. Love to Laura. [Goes.]
    </p>
    <p>
      [The Captain opens his desk and seats himself at it. Takes up account
      books.]
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN [Figuring.] Thirty-four&mdash;nine, forty-three&mdash;seven,
      eight, fifty-six&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA [Coming in from inner room.] Will you be kind enough&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Just a moment! Sixty-six&mdash;seventy-one, eighty-four,
      eighty-nine, ninety-two, a hundred. What is it?
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Am I disturbing you?
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Not at all. Housekeeping money, I suppose?
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Yes, housekeeping money.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Put the accounts down there and I will go over them.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. The accounts?
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Am I to keep accounts now?
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Of course you are to keep accounts. Our affairs are in a
      precarious condition, and in case of a liquidation, accounts are
      necessary, or one is liable to punishment for being careless.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. It's not my fault that our affairs are in a precarious condition.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. That is exactly what the accounts will decide.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. It's not my fault that our tenant doesn't pay.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Who recommended this tenant so warmly? You! Why did you recommend
      a&mdash;good-for-nothing, we'll call him?
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. But why did you rent to this good-for-nothing?
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Because I was not allowed to eat in peace, nor sleep in peace,
      nor work in peace, till you women got that man here. You wanted him so
      that your brother might be rid of him, your mother wanted him because I
      didn't want him, the governess wanted him because he reads his Bible, and
      old Margret because she had known his grandmother from childhood. That's
      why he was taken, and if he hadn't been taken, I'd be in a madhouse by now
      or lying in my grave. However, here is the housekeeping money and your pin
      money. You may give me the accounts later.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA [Curtesies.] Thanks so much. Do you too keep an account of what you
      spend besides the housekeeping money?
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. That doesn't concern you.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. No, that's true&mdash;just as little as my child's education
      concerns me. Have the gentlemen come to a decision after this evening's
      conference?
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. I had already come to a decision, and therefore it only remained
      for me to talk it over with the one friend I and the family have in
      common. Bertha is to go to boarding school in town, and starts in a
      fortnight.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. To which boarding school, if I may venture to ask?
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Professor Säfberg's.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. That free thinker!
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. According to the law, children are to be brought up in their
      father's faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. And the mother has no voice in the matter?
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. None whatever. She has sold her birthright by a legal
      transaction, and forfeited her rights in return for the man's
      responsibility of caring for her and her children.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. That is to say she has no rights concerning her child.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. No, none at all. When once one has sold one's goods, one cannot
      have them back and still keep the money.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. But if both father and mother should agree?
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Do you think that could ever happen? I want her to live in town,
      you want her to stay at home. The arithmetical result would be that she
      remain at the railway station midway between train and home. This is a
      knot that cannot be untied, you see.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Then it must be broken. What did Nöjd want here?
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. That is an official secret.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Which the whole kitchen knows!
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Good, then you must know it.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. I do know it.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. And have your judgment ready-made?
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. My judgment is the judgment of the law.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. But it is not written in the law who the child's father is.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. No, but one usually knows that.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Wise minds claim that one can never know.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. That's strange. Can't one ever know who the father of a child is?
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. No; so they claim.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. How extraordinary! How can the father have such control over the
      children then?
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. He has control only when he has assumed the responsibilities of
      the child, or has had them forced upon him. But in wedlock, of course,
      there is no doubt about the fatherhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. There are no doubts then?
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Well, I should hope not.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. But if the wife has been unfaithful?
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. That's another matter. Was there anything else you wanted to say?
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Then I shall go up to my room, and perhaps you will be kind
      enough to let me know when the doctor arrives. [Closes desk and rises]
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Certainly.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Captain goes through the primate door right.]
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. As soon as he comes. For I don't want to seem rude to him, you
      understand. [Goes.]
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. I understand. [Looks at the money she holds in her hands.]
    </p>
    <p>
      MOTHER-IN-LAW'S VOICE [Within.] Laura!
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      MOTHER-IN-LAW'S VOICE. Is my tea ready?
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA [In doorway to inner room]. In just a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Laura goes toward hall door at back as the orderly opens it.]
    </p>
    <p>
      ORDERLY. Doctor Ostermark.
    </p>
    <p>
      DOCTOR. Madam!
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA [Advances and offers her hand]. Welcome, Doctor&mdash;you are
      heartily welcome. The Captain is out, but he will be back soon.
    </p>
    <p>
      DOCTOR. I hope you will excuse my coming so late, but I have already been
      called upon to pay some professional visits.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Sit down, won't you?
    </p>
    <p>
      DOCTOR. Thank you.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Yes, there is a great deal of illness in the neighborhood just now,
      but I hope it will agree with you here. For us country people living in
      such isolation it is of great value to find a doctor who is interested in
      his patients, and I hear so many nice things of you, Doctor, that I hope
      the pleasantest relations will exist between us.
    </p>
    <p>
      DOCTOR. You are indeed kind, and I hope for your sake my visits to you
      will not often be caused by necessity. Your family is, I believe, as a
      rule in good health&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Fortunately we have bear spared acute illnesses, but still things
      are not altogether as they should be.
    </p>
    <p>
      DOCTOR. Indeed?
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Heaven knows, things are not as might be wished.
    </p>
    <p>
      DOCTOR. Really, you alarm me.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. There are some circumstances in a family which through honor and
      conscience one is forced to conceal from the whole world&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      DOCTOR. Excepting the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Exactly. It is, therefore, my painful duty to tell you the whole
      truth immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      DOCTOR. Shouldn't we postpone this conference until I have had the honor
      of being introduced to the Captain?
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. No! You must hear me before seeing him.
    </p>
    <p>
      DOCTOR. It relates to him then?
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Yes, to him, my poor, dear husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      DOCTOR. You alarm me, indeed, and believe me, I sympathize with your
      misfortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA [Taking out handkerchief]. My husband's mind is affected. Now you
      know all, and may judge for yourself when you see him.
    </p>
    <p>
      DOCTOR. What do you say? I have read the Captain's excellent treatises on
      mineralogy with admiration, and have found that they display a clear and
      powerful intellect.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Really? How happy I should be if we should all prove to be
      mistaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      DOCTOR. But of course it is possible that his mind might be affected in
      other directions.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. That is just what we fear, too. You see he has sometimes the most
      extraordinary ideas which, of course, one might expect in a learned man,
      if they did not have a disastrous effect on the welfare of his whole
      family. For instance, one of his whims is buying all kinds of things.
    </p>
    <p>
      DOCTOR. That is serious; but what does he buy?
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Whole boxes of books that he never reads.
    </p>
    <p>
      DOCTOR. There is nothing strange about a scholar's buying books.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. You don't believe what I am saying?
    </p>
    <p>
      DOCTOR. Well, Madam, I am convinced that you believe what you are saying.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Tell me, is it reasonable to think that one can see what is
      happening on another planet by looking through a microscope?
    </p>
    <p>
      DOCTOR. Does he say he can do that?
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Yes, that's what he says.
    </p>
    <p>
      DOCTOR. Through a microscope?
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Through a microscope, yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      DOCTOR. This is serious, if it is so.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. If it is so! Then you have no faith in me, Doctor, and here I sit
      confiding the family secret to&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      DOCTOR. Indeed, Madam, I am honored by your confidence, but as a physician
      I must investigate and observe before giving an opinion. Has the Captain
      ever shown any symptoms of indecision or instability of will?
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Has he! We have been married twenty years, and he has never yet
      made a decision without changing his mind afterward.
    </p>
    <p>
      DOCTOR. Is he obstinate?
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. He always insists on having his own way, but once he has got it he
      drops the whole matter and asks me to decide.
    </p>
    <p>
      DOCTOR. This is serious, and demands close observation. The will, you see,
      is the mainspring of the mind, and if it is affected the whole mind goes
      to pieces.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. God knows how I have taught myself to humor his wishes through all
      these long years of trial. Oh, if you knew what a life I have endured with
      him&mdash;if you only knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      DOCTOR. Your misfortune touches me deeply, and I promise you to see what
      can be done. I pity you with all my heart, and I beg you to trust me
      completely. But after what I have heard I must ask you to avoid suggesting
      any ideas that might make a deep impression on the patient, for in a weak
      brain they develop rapidly and quickly turn to monomania or fixed ideas.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. You mean to avoid arousing suspicions?
    </p>
    <p>
      DOCTOR. Exactly. One can make the insane believe anything, just because
      they are receptive to everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Indeed? Then I understand. Yes&mdash;yes. [A bell rings within.]
      Excuse me, my mother wishes to speak to me. One moment&mdash; &mdash;Ah,
      here is Adolf.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Captain comes in through private door.]
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Oh, here already, Doctor? You are very welcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      DOCTOR. Captain! It is a very great pleasure to me to make the
      acquaintance of so celebrated a man of science.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Oh, I beg of you. The duties of service do not allow me to make
      any very profound investigations, but I believe I am now really on the
      track of a discovery.
    </p>
    <p>
      DOCTOR. Indeed?
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. You see, I have submitted meteoric stones to spectrum analysis,
      with the result that I have found carbon, that, is to say, a clear trace
      of organic life. What do you say to that?
    </p>
    <p>
      DOCTOR. Can you see that with it microscope?
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Lord, no&mdash;with the spectroscope.
    </p>
    <p>
      DOCTOR. The spectroscope! Pardon. Then you will soon be able to tell us
      what is happening on Jupiter.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Not what is happening, but what has happened. If only the
      confounded booksellers in Paris would send me the books; but I believe all
      the booksellers in the universe have conspired against me. Think of it,
      for the last two months not a single one has ever answered my
      communications, neither letters nor abusive telegrams. I shall go mad over
      it, and I can't imagine what's the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      DOCTOR. Oh, I suppose it's the usual carelessness; you mustn't let it vex
      you so.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. But the devil of it is I shall not get my treatise done in time,
      and I know they are working along the same lines in Berlin. But we
      shouldn't be talking about this&mdash;but about you. If you care to live
      here we have rooms for you in the wing, or perhaps you would rather live
      in the old quarters?
    </p>
    <p>
      DOCTOR. Just as you like.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. No, as you like. Which is it to be?
    </p>
    <p>
      DOCTOR. You must decide that, Captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. No, it's not for me to decide. You must say which you prefer. I
      have no preference in the matter, none at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      DOCTOR. Oh, but I really cannot decide.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. For heaven's sake, Doctor, say which you prefer. I have no choice
      in the matter, no opinion, no wishes. Haven't you got character enough to
      know what you want? Answer me, or I shall be provoked.
    </p>
    <p>
      DOCTOR. Well, if it rests with me, I prefer to live here.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Thank you&mdash;forgive me, Doctor, but nothing annoys me so
      touch as to see people undecided about anything. [Nurse comes in.] Oh,
      there you are, Margret. Do you happen to know whether the rooms in the
      wing are in order for the Doctor?
    </p>
    <p>
      NURSE. Yes, sir, they are.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Very well. Then I won't detain you, Doctor; you must be tired.
      Good bye, and welcome once more. I shall see you tomorrow, I hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      DOCTOR. Good evening, Captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. I daresay that my wife explained conditions here to you a little,
      so that you have some idea how the land lies?
    </p>
    <p>
      DOCTOR. Yes, your excellent wife has given me a few hints about this and
      that, such as were necessary to a stranger. Good evening, Captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN [To Nurse]. What do you want, you old dear? What is it?
    </p>
    <p>
      NURSE. Now, little Master Adolf, just listen&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Yes, Margret, you are the only one I can listen to without having
      spasms.
    </p>
    <p>
      NURSE. Now, listen, Mr. Adolf. Don't you think you should go half-way and
      come to an agreement with Mistress in this fuss over the child? Just think
      of a mother&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Think of a father, Margret.
    </p>
    <p>
      NURSE. There, there, there. A father has something besides his child, but
      a mother has nothing but her child.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Just so, you old dear. She has only one burden, but I have three,
      and I have her burden too. Don't you think that I should hold a better
      position in the world than that of a poor soldier if I had not had her and
      her child?
    </p>
    <p>
      NURSE. Well, that isn't what I wanted to talk about.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. I can well believe that, for you wanted to make it appear that I
      am in the wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      NURSE. Don't you believe, Mr. Adolf, that I wish you well?
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Yes, dear friend, I do believe it; but you don't know what is for
      my good. You see it isn't enough for me to have given the child life, I
      want to give her my soul, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      NURSE. Such things I don't understand. But I do think that you ought to be
      able to agree.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. You are not my friend, Margret.
    </p>
    <p>
      NURSE. I? Oh, Lord, what are you saying, Mr. Adolf? Do you think I can
      forget that you were my child when you were little?
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Well, you dear, have I forgotten it? You have been like a mother
      to me, and always have stood by me when I had everybody against me, but
      now, when I really need you, you desert me and go over to the enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      NURSE. The enemy!
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN, Yes, the enemy! You know well enough how things are in this
      house! You have seen everything from the beginning.
    </p>
    <p>
      NURSE. Indeed I have seen! But, God knows, why two people should torment
      the life out of each other; two people who are otherwise so good and wish
      all others well. Mistress is never like that to me or to others&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Only to me, I know it. But let me tell you, Margret, if you
      desert me now, you will do wrong. For now they have begun to weave a plot
      against me, and that doctor is not my friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      NURSE. Oh, Mr. Adolf, you believe evil about everybody. But you see it's
      because you haven't the true faith; that's just what it is.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Yes, you and the Baptists have found the only true faith. You are
      indeed lucky!
    </p>
    <p>
      NURSE. Anyway, I'm not unhappy like you, Mr. Adolf. Humble your heart and
      you will see that God will make you happy in your love for your neighbor.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. It's a strange thing that you no sooner speak of God and love
      than your voice becomes hard and your eyes fill with hate. No, Margret,
      surely you have not the true faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      NURSE. Yes, go on being proud and hard in your learning, but it won't
      amount to much when it comes to the test.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. How mightily you talk, humble heart. I know very well that
      knowledge is of no use to you women.
    </p>
    <p>
      NURSE. You ought to be ashamed of yourself. But in spite of everything old
      Margret cares most for her great big boy, and he will come back to the
      fold when it's stormy weather.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Margret! Forgive me, but believe me when I say that there is no
      one here who wishes me well but you. Help me, for I feel that something is
      going to happen here. What it is, I don't know, but something evil is on
      the way. [Scream from within.] What's that? Who's that screaming?
    </p>
    <p>
      [Berths enters from inner room.]
    </p>
    <p>
      BERTHA. Father! Father! Help me; save me.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. My dear child, what is it? Speak!
    </p>
    <p>
      BERTHA. Help me. She wants to hurt me.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Who wants to hurt you? Tell me! Speak!
    </p>
    <p>
      BERTHA. Grandmother! But it's my fault for I deceived her.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Tell me more.
    </p>
    <p>
      BERTHA. Yes, but you mustn't say anything about it. Promise me you won't.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Tell me what it is then.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Nurse goes.]
    </p>
    <p>
      BERTHA. In the evening she generally turns down the lamp and then she
      makes me sit at a table holding a pen over a piece of paper. And then she
      says that the spirits are to write.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. What's all this&mdash;and you have never told me about it?
    </p>
    <p>
      BERTHA. Forgive me, but I dared not, for Grandmother says the spirits take
      revenge if one talks about them. And then the pen writes, but I don't know
      whether I'm doing it or not. Sometimes it goes well, but sometimes it
      won't go at all, and when I am tired nothing comes, but she wants it to
      come just the same. And tonight I thought I was writing beautifully, but
      then grandmother said it was all from Stagnelius, and that I had deceived
      her, and then she got terribly angry.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Do you believe that there are spirits?
    </p>
    <p>
      BERTHA. I don't know.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. But I know that there are none.
    </p>
    <p>
      BERTHA. But Grandmother says that you don't understand, Father, and that
      you do much worse things&mdash;you who can see to other planets.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Does she say that! Does she say that? What else does she say?
    </p>
    <p>
      BERTHA. She says that you can't work witchery.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. I never said that I could. You know what meteoric stones are,&mdash;stones
      that fall from other heavenly bodies. I can examine them and learn whether
      they contain the same elements as our world. That is all I can tell.
    </p>
    <p>
      BERTHA. But Grandmother says that there are things that she can see which
      you cannot see.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Then she lies.
    </p>
    <p>
      BERTHA. Grandmother doesn't tell lies.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Why doesn't she?
    </p>
    <p>
      BERTHA. Then Mother tells lies too.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. H'm!
    </p>
    <p>
      BERTHA. And if you say that Mother lies, I can never believe in you again.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. I have not said so; and so you must believe in me when I tell you
      that it is for your future good that you should leave home. Will you? Will
      you go to town and learn something useful?
    </p>
    <p>
      BERTHA. Oh, yes, I should love to go to town, away from here, anywhere. If
      I can only see you sometimes&mdash;often. Oh, it is so gloomy and awful in
      there all the time, like a winter night, but when you come home Father, it
      is like a morning in spring when they take off the double windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. My beloved child! My dear child!
    </p>
    <p>
      BERTHA. But, Father, you'll be good to Mother, won't you? She cries so
      often.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. H'm&mdash;then you want to go to town?
    </p>
    <p>
      BERTHA. Yes, yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. But if Mother doesn't want you to go?
    </p>
    <p>
      BERTHA. But she must let me.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. But if she won't?
    </p>
    <p>
      BERTHA. Well, then, I don't know what will happen. But she must! She must!
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Will you ask her?
    </p>
    <p>
      BERTHA. You must ask her very nicely; she wouldn't pay any attention to my
      asking.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. H'm! Now if you wish it, and I wish it, and she doesn't wish it,
      what shall we do then?
    </p>
    <p>
      BERTHA. Oh, then it will all be in a tangle again! Why can't you both&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      [Laura comes in.]
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Oh, so Bertha is here. Then perhaps we may have her own opinion as
      the question of her future has to be decided.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. The child can hardly have any well-grounded opinion about what a
      young girl's life is likely to be, while we, on the contrary, can more
      easily estimate what it may be, as we have seen so many young girls grow
      up.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. But as we are of different opinions Bertha must be the one to
      decide.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. No, I let no one usurp my rights, neither women nor children.
      Bertha, leave us.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Bertha goes out.]
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. You were afraid of hearing her opinion, because you thought it
      would be to my advantage.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. I know that she wishes to go away from home, but I know also that
      you possess the power of changing her mind to suit your pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Oh, am I really so powerful?
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Yes, you have a fiendish power of getting your own way; but so
      has anyone who does not scruple about, the way it is accomplished. How did
      you get Doctor Norling away, for instance, and how did you get this new
      doctor here?
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Yes, how did I manage that?
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. You insulted the other one so much that he left, and made your
      brother recommend this fellow.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Well, that was quite simple and legitimate. Is Bertha to leave home
      now?
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Yes, she is to start in a fortnight.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. That is your decision?
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Then I must try to prevent it.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. You cannot.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Can't I? Do you really think I would trust my daughter to wicked
      people to have her taught that everything her mother has implanted in her
      child is mere foolishness? Why, afterward, she would despise me all the
      rest of her life!
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Do you think that a father should allow ignorant and conceited
      women to teach his daughter that he is a charlatan?
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. It means less to the father.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Why so?
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Because the mother is closer to the child, as it has been
      discovered that no one can tell for a certainty who the father of a child
      is.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. How does that apply to this case?
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. You do not know whether you are Bertha's father or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. I do not know?
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. No; what no one knows, you surely cannot know.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Are you joking?
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. No; I am only making use of your own teaching. For that matter, how
      do you know that I have not been unfaithful to you?
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. I believe you capable of almost anything, but not that, nor that
      you would talk about it if it were true.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Suppose that I was prepared to bear anything, even to being
      despised and driven out, everything for the sake of being able to keep and
      control my child, and that I am truthful now when I declare that Bertha is
      my child, but not yours. Suppose&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Stop now!
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Just suppose this. In that case your power would be at an end.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. When you had proved that I was not the father.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. That would not be difficult! Would you like me to do so?
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Stop!
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Of course I should only need to declare the name of the real
      father, give all details of place and time. For instance&mdash;when was
      Bertha born? In the third year of our marriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Stop now, or else&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Or else, what? Shall we stop now? Think carefully about all you do
      and decide, and whatever you do, don't make yourself ridiculous.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. I consider all this most lamentable.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Which makes you all the more ridiculous.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. And you?
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Oh, we women are really too clever.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. That's why one cannot contend with you.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Then why provoke contests with a superior enemy?
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Superior?
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Yes, it's queer, but I have never looked at a man without knowing
      myself to be his superior.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Then you shall be made to see your superior for once, so that you
      shall never forget it.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. That will be interesting.
    </p>
    <p>
      NURSE [comes in]. Supper is served. Will you come in?
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Very well.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Captain lingers; sits down with a magazine in an arm chair near table.]
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Aren't you coming in to supper?
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. No, thanks. I don't want anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. What, are you annoyed?
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. No, but I am not hungry.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Come, or they will ask unnecessary questions&mdash;be good now. You
      won't? Stay there then. [Goes.]
    </p>
    <p>
      NURSE. Mr. Adolf! What is this all about?
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. I don't know what it is. Can you explain to me why you women
      treat an old man as if he were a child?
    </p>
    <p>
      NURSE. I don't understand it, but it must be because all you men, great
      and small, are women's children, every man of you.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. But no women are born of men. Yes, but I am Bertha's father. Tell
      me, Margret, don't you believe it? Don't you?
    </p>
    <p>
      NURSE. Lord, how silly you are. Of course you are your own child's father.
      Come and eat now, and don't sit there and sulk. There, there, come now.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Get out, woman. To hell with the hags. [Goes to private door.]
      Svärd, Svärd!
    </p>
    <p>
      [Orderly comes in.]
    </p>
    <p>
      ORDERLY. Yes, Captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Hitch into the covered sleigh at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      NURSE. Captain, listen to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Out, woman! At once!
    </p>
    <p>
      [Orderly goes.]
    </p>
    <p>
      NURSE. Good Lord, what's going to happen now.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Captain puts on his cap and coat and prepares to go out.]
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Don't expect me home before midnight. [Goes.]
    </p>
    <p>
      NURSE. Lord preserve us, whatever will be the end of this!

      ACT II.
    </h2>
    <p>
      [The same scene as in previous act. A lighted lamp is on the table; it is
      night. The Doctor and Laura are discovered at rise of curtain.]
    </p>
    <p>
      DOCTOR. From what I gathered during my conversation with him the case is
      not fully proved to me. In the first place you made a mistake in saying
      that he had arrived at these astonishing results about other heavenly
      bodies by means of a microscope. Now that I have learned that it was a
      spectroscope, he is not only cleared of any suspicion of insanity, but has
      rendered a great service to science.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Yes, but I never said that.
    </p>
    <p>
      DOCTOR. Madam, I made careful notes of our conversation, and I remember
      that I asked about this very point because I thought I had misunderstood
      you. One must be very careful in making such accusations when a
      certificate in lunacy is in question.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. A certificate in lunacy?
    </p>
    <p>
      DOCTOR. Yes, you must surely know that an insane person loses both civil
      and family rights.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. No, I did not know that.
    </p>
    <p>
      DOCTOR. There was another matter that seemed to me suspicious. He spoke of
      his communications to his booksellers not being answered. Permit me to ask
      if you, through motives of mistaken kindness, have intercepted them?
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Yes, I have. It was my duty to guard the interests of the family,
      and I could not let him ruin us all without some intervention.
    </p>
    <p>
      DOCTOR. Pardon me, but I think you cannot have considered the consequences
      of such an act. If he discovers your secret interference in his affairs,
      he will have grounds for suspicions, and they will grow like an avalanche.
      And besides, in doing this you have thwarted his will and irritated him
      still more. You must have felt yourself how the mind rebels when one's
      deepest desires are thwarted and one's will is crossed.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Haven't I felt that!
    </p>
    <p>
      DOCTOR. Think, then, what he must have gone through.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA [Rising]. It is midnight and he hasn't come home. Now we may fear
      the worst.
    </p>
    <p>
      DOCTOR. But tell me what actually happened this evening after I left. I
      must know everything.

    <p>
      LAURA. He raved in the wildest way and had the strangest ideas. For
      instance, that he is not the father of his child.
    </p>
    <p>
      DOCTOR. That is strange. How did such an idea come into his head?
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. I really can't imagine, unless it was because he had to question
      one of the men about supporting a child, and when I tried to defend the
      girl, he grew excited and said no one could tell who was the father of a
      child. God knows I did everything to calm him, but now I believe there is
      no help for him. [Cries.]
    </p>
    <p>
      DOCTOR. But this cannot go on. Something must be done here without, of
      course, arousing his suspicions. Tell me, has the Captain ever had such
      delusions before?
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Six years ago things were in the same state, and then he, himself,
      confessed in his own letter to the doctor that he feared for his reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      DOCTOR. Yes, yes, yes, this is a story that has deep roots and the
      sanctity of the family life&mdash;and so on&mdash;of course I cannot ask
      about everything, but must limit myself to appearances. What is done can't
      be undone, more's the pity, yet the remedy should be based upon all the
      past.&mdash;Where do you think he is now?
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. I have no idea, he has such wild streaks.
    </p>
    <p>
      DOCTOR. Would you like to have me stay until he returns? To avoid
      suspicion, I could say that I had come to see your mother who is not well.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Yes, that will do very nicely. Don't leave us, Doctor; if you only
      knew how troubled I am! But wouldn't it be better to tell him outright
      what you think of his condition.
    </p>
    <p>
      DOCTOR. We never do that unless the patient mentions the subject himself,
      and very seldom even then. It depends entirely on the case. But we mustn't
      sit here; perhaps I had better go into the next room; it will look more
      natural.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Yes, that will be better, and Margret can sit here. She always
      waits up when he is out, and she is the only one who has any power over
      him. [Goes to the door left] Margret, Margret!
    </p>
    <p>
      NURSE. Yes, Ma'am. Has the master come home?
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. No; but you are to sit here and wait for him, and when he does come
      you are to say my mother is ill and that's why the doctor is here.
    </p>
    <p>
      NURSE. Yes, yes. I'll see that everything is all right.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA [Opens the door to inner rooms]. Will you come in here, Doctor?
    </p>
    <p>
      DOCTOR. Thank you.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Nurse seats herself at the table and takes up a hymn book and spectacles
      and reads.]
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
NURSE. Ah, yes, ah yes!                       [Reads half aloud]
    Ah woe is me, how sad a thing
    Is life within this vale of tears,
  Death's angel triumphs like a king,
    And calls aloud to all the spheres&mdash;        Vanity, all is vanity.
    Yes, yes! Yes, yes!
                       [Reads again]
    All that on earth hath life and breath
    To earth must fall before his spear,
    And sorrow, saved alone from death,
    Inscribes above the mighty bier.
        Vanity, all is vanity.
    Yes, Yes.

    <p>
      BERTHA [Comes in with a coffee-pot and some embroidery. She speaks in a
      low voice]. Margret, may I sit with you? It is so frightfully lonely up
      there.
    </p>
    <p>
      NURSE. For goodness sake, are you still up, Bertha?
    </p>
    <p>
      BERTHA. You see I want to finish Father's Christmas present. And here's
      something that you'll like.
    </p>
    <p>
      NURSE. But bless my soul, this won't do. You must be up in the morning,
      and it's after midnight now.
    </p>
    <p>
      BERTHA. What does it matter? I don't dare sit up there alone. I believe
      the spirits are at work.
    </p>
    <p>
      NURSE. You see, just what I've said. Mark my words, this house was not
      built on a lucky spot. What did you hear?
    </p>
    <p>
      BERTHA. Think of it, I heard some one singing up in the attic!
    </p>
    <p>
      NURSE. In the attic? At this hour?
    </p>
    <p>
      BERTHA. Yes, it was such it sorrowful, melancholy song! I never heard
      anything like it. It sounded as if it came from the store-room, where the
      cradle stands, you know, to the left&mdash; &mdash; &mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      NURSE. Dear me, Dear me! And such a fearful night. It seems as if the
      chimneys would blow down. "Ah, what is then this earthly life, But grief,
      afliction and great strife? E'en when fairest it has seemed, Nought but
      pain it can be deemed." Ah, dear child, may God give us a good Christmas!
    </p>
    <p>
      BERTHA. Margret, is it true that Father is ill?
    </p>
    <p>
      NURSE. Yes, I'm afraid he is.
    </p>
    <p>
      BERTHA. Then we can't keep Christmas eve? But how can he be up and around
      if he is 111?
    </p>
    <p>
      NURSE. You see, my child, the kind of illness he has doesn't keep him from
      being up. Hush, there's some one out in the hall. Go to bed now and take
      the coffee pot away or the master will be angry.
    </p>
    <p>
      BERTHA [Going out with tray]. Good night, Margret.
    </p>
    <p>
      NURSE. Good night, my child. God bless you.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Captain comes in, takes off his overcoat.]
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Are you still up? Go to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      NURSE. I was only waiting till&mdash; &mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      [Captain lights a candle, opens his desk, sits down at it and takes
      letters and newspapers out of his pocket.]
    </p>
    <p>
      NURSE. Mr. Adolf.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. What do you want?
    </p>
    <p>
      NURSE. Old mistress is ill and the doctor is here.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Is it anything dangerous?
    </p>
    <p>
      NURSE. No, I don't think so. Just a cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN [Gets up]. Margret, who was the father of your child?
    </p>
    <p>
      NURSE. Oh, I've told you many and many a time; it was that scamp
      Johansson.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Are you sure that it was he?
    </p>
    <p>
      NURSE. How childish you are; of course I'm sure when he was the only one.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Yes, but was he sure that he was the only one? No, he could not
      be, but you could be sure of it. There is a difference, you see.
    </p>
    <p>
      NURSE. Well, I can't see any difference.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. No, you cannot see it, but the difference exists, nevertheless.
      [Turns over the pages of a photograph album which is on the table.] Do you
      think Bertha looks like me?
    </p>
    <p>
      NURSE. Of course! Why, you are as like as two peas.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Did Johansson confess that he was the father?
    </p>
    <p>
      NURSE. He was forced to!
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. How terrible! Here is the Doctor. [Doctor comes in.] Good
      evening, Doctor. How is my mother-in-law?
    </p>
    <p>
      DOCTOR. Oh, it's nothing serious; merely a slight sprain of the left
      ankle.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. I thought Margret said it was a cold. There seem to be different
      opinions about the same case. Go to bed, Margret.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Nurse goes. A pause.]
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Sit down, Doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      DOCTOR [Sits]. Thanks.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Is it true that you obtain striped foals if you cross a zebra and
      a mare?
    </p>
    <p>
      DOCTOR [Astonished]. Perfectly true.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Is it true that the foals continue to be striped if the breed is
      continued with a stallion?
    </p>
    <p>
      DOCTOR. Yes, that is true, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. That is to say, under certain conditions a stallion can be sire
      to striped foals or the opposite?
    </p>
    <p>
      DOCTOR. Yes, so it seems.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Therefore an offspring's likeness to the father proves nothing?
    </p>
    <p>
      DOCTOR. Well&mdash; &mdash; &mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. That is to say, paternity cannot be proven.
    </p>
    <p>
      DOCTOR. H'm&mdash; &mdash;well&mdash; &mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. You are a widower, aren't you, and have had children?
    </p>
    <p>
      DOCTOR. Ye-es.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Didn't you ever feel ridiculous as a. father? I know of nothing
      so ludicrous as to see a father leading his children by the hand around
      the streets, or to hear it father talk about his children. "My wife's
      children," he ought to say. Did you ever feel how false your position was?
      Weren't you ever afflicted with doubts, I won't say suspicions, for, as a
      gentleman, I assume that your wife was above suspicion.
    </p>
    <p>
      DOCTOR. No, really, I never was; but, Captain, I believe Goethe says a man
      must take his children on good faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. It's risky to take anything on good faith where a woman is
      concerned.
    </p>
    <p>
      DOCTOR. Oh, there are so many kinds of women.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Modern investigations have pronounced that there is only one
      kind! Lately I have recalled two instances in my life that make me believe
      this. When I was young I was strong and, if I may boast, handsome. Once
      when I was making a trip on a steamer and sitting with a few friends in
      the saloon, the young stewardess came and flung herself down by me, burst
      into tears, and told us that her sweetheart was drowned. We sympathized
      with her, and I ordered some champagne. After the second glass I touched
      her foot; after the fourth her knee, and before morning I had consoled
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      DOCTOR. That was just a winter fly.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Now comes the second instance&mdash;and that was a real summer
      fly. I was at Lyskil. There was a young married woman stopping there with
      her children, but her husband was in town. She was religious, had
      extremely strict principles, preached morals to me, and was, I believe,
      entirely honorable. I lent her a book, two books, and when she was
      leaving, she returned them, strange to say! Three months later, in those
      very books I found her card with a declaration on it. It was innocent, as
      innocent its it declaration of love can be from a married woman to a
      strange man who never made any advances. Now comes the moral: Just don't
      have too much faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      DOCTOR. Don't have too little faith either.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. No, but just enough. But, you see, Doctor, that woman was so
      unconsciously dishonest that she talked to her husband about the fancy she
      had taken to me. That's what makes it dangerous, this very unconsciousness
      of their instinctive dishonesty. That is a mitigating circumstance, I
      admit, but it cannot nullify judgment, only soften it.
    </p>
    <p>
      DOCTOR. Captain, your thoughts are taking a morbid turn, and you ought to
      control them.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. You must not use the word morbid. Steam boilers, as you know,
      explode at it certain pressure, but the same pressure is not needed for
      all boiler explosions. You understand? However, you are here to watch me.
      If I were not a man I should have the right to make accusations or
      complaints, as they are so cleverly called, and perhaps I should be able
      to give you the whole diagnosis, and, what is more, the history of my
      disease. But unfortunately, I am a man, and there is nothing for me to do
      but, like a Roman, fold my arms across my breast and hold my breath till I
      die.
    </p>
    <p>
      DOCTOR. Captain, if you are ill, it will not reflect upon your honor as a
      man to tell me all. In fact, I ought to hear the other side.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. You have had enough in hearing the one, I imagine. Do you know
      when I heard Mrs. Alving eulogizing her dead husband, I thought to myself
      what a damned pity it was the fellow was dead. Do you suppose that he
      would have spoken if he had been alive? And do you suppose that if any of
      the dead husbands came back they would be believed? Good night, Doctor.
      You see that I am calm, and you can retire without fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      DOCTOR. Good night, then, Captain. I'm afraid. I can be of no further use
      in this case.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Are we enemies?
    </p>
    <p>
      DOCTOR. Far from it. But it is too bad we cannot be friends. Good night.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Goes. The Captain follows the Doctor to the door at back and then goes to
      the door at left and opens it slightly.]
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Come in, and we'll talk. I heard you out there listening. [Laura,
      embarrassed. Captain sits at desk.] It is late, but we must come to some
      decision. Sit down. [Pause.] I have been at the post office tonight to get
      my letters. From these it appears that you have been keeping back my mail,
      both coming and going. The consequence of which is that the loss of time
      has its good as destroyed the result I expected from my work.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. It was an act of kindness on my part, as you neglected the service
      for this other work.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. It was hardly kindness, for you were quite sure that some day I
      should win more honor from that, than from the service; but you were
      particularly anxious that I should not win such honors, for fear your own
      insignificance would be emphasized by it. In consequence of all this I
      have intercepted letters addressed to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. That was a noble act.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. You see, you have, as you might say, a high opinion of me. It
      appears from these letters that, for some time past you have been arraying
      my old friends against me by spreading reports about my mental condition.
      And you Dave succeeded in your efforts, for now not more than one person
      exists from the Colonel down to the cook, who believes that I am sane. Now
      these are the facts about my illness; my mind is sound, as you know, so
      that I can take care of my duties in the service as well its my
      responsibilities as a father; my feelings are more or less under my
      control, as my will has not been completely undermined; but you have
      gnawed and nibbled at it so that it will soon slip the cogs, and then the
      whole mechanism will slip and go to smash. I will not appeal to your
      feelings, for you have none; that is your strength; but I will appeal to
      your interests.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Let me hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. You have succeeded in arousing my suspicions to such an extent
      that my judgment is no longer clear, and my thoughts begin to wander. This
      is the approaching insanity that you are waiting for, which may come at
      any time now. So you are face to face with the question whether it is more
      to your interest that I should be sane or insane. Consider. If I go under
      I shall lose the service, and where will you be then? If I die, my life
      insurance will fall to you. But if I take my own life, you will get
      nothing. Consequently, it is to your interest that I should live out my
      life.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Is this a trap?
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. To be sure. But it rests with you whether you will run around it
      or stick your head into it.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. You say that you will kill yourself! You won't do that!
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Are you sure? Do you think a man can live when he has nothing and
      no one to live for?
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. You surrender, then?
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. No, I offer peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. The conditions?
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. That I may keep my reason. Free me from my suspicions and I give
      up the conflict.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. What suspicions?
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. About Bertha's origin.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Are there any doubts about that?
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Yes, I have doubts, and you have awakened them.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. I?
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Yes, you have dropped them like henbane in my ears, and
      circumstances have strengthened them. Free me from the uncertainty; tell
      me outright that it is true and I will forgive you beforehand.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. How can I acknowledge a sin that I have not committed?
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. What does it matter when you know that I shall not divulge it? Do
      you think a man would go and spread his own shame broadcast?
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. If I say it isn't true, you won't be convinced; but if I say it is,
      then you will be convinced. You seem to hope it is true!
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Yes, strangely enough; it must be, because the first supposition
      can't be proved; the latter can be.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Have you tiny ground for your suspicions?
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Yes, and no.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. I believe you want to prove me guilty, so that you can get rid of
      me and then have absolute control over the child. But you won't catch me
      in any such snare.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Do you think that I would want to be responsible for another
      man's child, if I were convinced of your guilt?
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. No, I'm sure you wouldn't, and that's what makes me know you lied
      just now when you said that you would forgive me beforehand.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. [Rises]. Laura, save me and my reason. You don't seem to
      understand what I say. If the child is not mine I have no control over her
      and don't want to have any, and that is precisely what you do want, isn't
      it? But perhaps you want even more&mdash;to have power over the child, but
      still have me to support you.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Power, yes! What has this whole life and death struggle been for
      but power?
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. To me it has meant more. I do not believe in a hereafter; the
      child was my future life. That was my conception of immortality, and
      perhaps the only one that has any analogy in reality. If you take that
      away from me, you cut off my life.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Why didn't we separate in time?
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Because the child bound us together; but the link became a chain.
      And how did it happen; how? I have never thought about this, but now
      memories rise up accusingly, condemningly perhaps. We had been married two
      years, and had no children; you know why. I fell ill and lay at the point
      of death. During a conscious interval of the fever I heard voices out in
      the drawing-room. It was you and the lawyer talking about the fortune that
      I still possessed. He explained that you could inherit nothing because we
      had no children, and he asked you if you were expecting to become a
      mother. I did not hear your reply. I recovered and we had a child. Who is
      its father?
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. You.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. No, I am not. Here is a buried crime that begins to stench, and
      what a hellish crime! You women have been compassionate enough to free the
      black slaves, but you have kept the white ones. I have worked and slaved
      for you, your child, your mother, your servants; I have sacrificed
      promotion and career; I have endured torture, flagellation, sleeplessness,
      worry for your sake, until my hair has grown gray; and all that you might
      enjoy a life without care, and when you grew old, enjoy life over again in
      your child. I have borne everything without complaint, because I thought
      myself the father of your child. This is the commonest kind of theft, the
      most brutal slavery. I have had seventeen years of penal servitude and
      have been innocent. What can you give me in return for that?
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Now you are quite mad.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. That is your hope!&mdash;And I see how you have labored to
      conceal your crime. I sympathized with you because I did not understand
      your grief. I have often lulled your evil conscience to rest when I
      thought I was driving away morbid thoughts. I have heard you cry out in
      your sleep and not wanted to listen. I remember now night before last&mdash;Bertha's
      birthday&mdash;it was between two and three in the morning, and I was
      sitting up reading; you shrieked, "Don't, don't!" as if someone were
      strangling you; I knocked on the wall&mdash;I didn't want to hear any
      more. I have had my suspicions for a long time but I did not dare to hear
      them confirmed. All this I have suffered for you. What will you do for me?
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. What can I do? I will swear by God and all I hold sacred that you
      are Bertha's father.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. What use is that when you have often said that a mother can and
      ought to commit any crime for her child? I implore you as a wounded man
      begs for a death blow, to tell me all. Don't you see I'm as helpless as a
      child? Don't you hear me complaining as to a mother? Won't you forget that
      I am a man, that I am a soldier who can tame men and beasts with a word?
      Like a sick man I only ask for compassion. I lay down the tokens of my
      power and implore you to have mercy on my life.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Laura approaches him and lays her hand on his brow.]
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. What! You are crying, man!
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Yes, I am crying although I am a man. But has not a man eyes! Has
      not a man hands, limbs, senses, thoughts, passions? Is he not fed with the
      wine food, hurt by the same weapons, warmed and cooled by the same summer
      and winter as a woman? If you prick us do we not bleed? If you tickle us
      do we not laugh? And if you poison us, do we not die? Why shouldn't a man
      complain, a soldier weep? Because it is unmanly? Why is it unmanly?
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Weep then, my child, as if you were with your mother once more. Do
      you remember when I first came into your life, I was like a second mother?
      Your great strong body needed nerves; you were a giant child that had
      either come too early into the world, or perhaps was not wanted at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Yes, that's how it was. My father's and my mother's will was
      against my coming into the world, and consequently I was born without a
      will. I thought I was completing myself when you and I became one, and
      therefore you were allowed to rule, and I, the commander at the barracks
      and before the troops, became obedient to you, grew through you, looked up
      to you as to it more highly-gifted being, listened to you as if I had been
      your undeveloped child.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Yes, that's the way it was, and therefore I loved you as my child.
      But you know, you must have seen, when the nature of your feelings changed
      and you appeared as my lover that I blushed, and your embraces were joy
      that was followed by a remorseful conscience as if my blood were ashamed.
      The mother became the mistress. Ugh!
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. I saw it, but I did not understand. I believed you despised me
      for my unmanliness, and I wanted to win you as a woman by being a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Yes, but there was the mistake. The mother was your friend, you
      see, but the woman was your enemy, and love between the sexes is strife.
      Do not think that I gave myself; I did not give, but I took&mdash;what I
      wanted. But you had one advantage. I felt that, and I wanted you to feel
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. You always had the advantage. You could hypnotize me when I was
      wide awake, so that I neither saw nor heard, but merely obeyed; you could
      give me a raw potato and make me imagine it was a peach; you could force
      me to admire your foolish caprices as though they were strokes of genius.
      You could have influenced me to crime, yes, even to mean, paltry deeds.
      Because you lacked intelligence, instead of carrying out my ideas you
      acted on your own judgment. But when at last I awoke, I realized that my
      honor had been corrupted and I wanted to blot out the memory by a great
      deed, an achievement, a discovery, or an honorable suicide. I wanted to go
      to war, but was not permitted. It was then that I threw myself into
      science. And now when I was about to reach out my hand to gather in its
      fruits, you chop off my arm. Now I am dishonored and can live no longer,
      for a man cannot live without honor.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. But a woman?
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Yes, for she has her children, which he has not. But, like the
      rest of mankind, we lived our lives unconscious as children, full of
      imagination, ideals, and illusions, and then we awoke; it was all over.
      But we awoke with our feet on the pillow, and he who waked us was himself
      a sleep-walker. When women grow old and cease to be women, they get beards
      on their chins; I wonder what men get when they grow old and cease to be
      men. Those who crowed were no longer cocks but capons, and the pullets
      answered their call, so that when we thought the sun was about to rise we
      found ourselves in the bright moon light amid ruins, just as in the good
      old times. It had only been a little morning slumber with wild dreams, and
      there was no awakening.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Do you know, you should have been a poet!
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Who knows.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Now I am sleepy, so if you have any more fantastic visions keep
      them till to-morrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. First, a word more about realities. Do you hate me?
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Yes, sometimes, when you are a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. This is like race hatred. If it is true that we are descended
      from monkeys, at least it must be from two separate species. We are
      certainly not like one another, are we?
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. What do you mean to say by all this?
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. I feel that one of us must go under in this struggle.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Which?
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. The weaker, of course.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. And the stronger will be in the right?
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Always, since he has the power.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Then I am in the right.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Have you the power already then?
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Yes, and a legal power with which I shall put you under the control
      of a guardian.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Under a guardian?
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. And then I shall educate my child without listening to your
      fantastic notions.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. And who will pay for the education when I am no longer here?
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Your pension will pay for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN [Threateningly]. How can you have me put under a guardian?
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA [Takes out a letter]. With this letter of which an attested copy is
      in the hands of the board of lunacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. What letter?
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA [Moving backward toward the door left]. Yours! Your declaration to
      the doctor that you are insane. [The Captain stares at her in silence.]
      Now you have fulfilled your function as an unfortunately necessary father
      and breadwinner, you are not needed any longer and you must go. You must
      go, since you have realized that my intellect is as strong as my will, and
      since you will not stay and acknowledge it.
    </p>
    <p>
      [The Captain goes to the table, seizes the lighted lamp and hurls it at
      Laura, who disappears backward through the door.]

      [Same Scene. Another lamp on the table. The private door is barricaded

    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA [to Nurse]. Did he give you the keys?
    </p>
    <p>
      NURSE. Give them to me, no! God help me, but I took them from the master's
      clothes that Nöjd had out to brush.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Oh, Nöjd is on duty today?
    </p>
    <p>
      NURSE. Yes, Nöjd.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Give me the keys.
    </p>
    <p>
      NURSE. Yes, but this seems like downright stealing. Do you hear him
      walking up there, Ma'am? Back and forth, back and forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Is the door well barred?
    </p>
    <p>
      NURSE. Oh, yes, it's barred well enough!
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Control your feelings, Margret. We must be calm if we are to be
      saved. [Knock.] Who is it?
    </p>
    <p>
      NURSE [Opens door to hall]. It is Nöjd.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Let him come in.
    </p>
    <p>
      NÖJD [Comes in]. A message from the Colonel.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Give it to me [Reads] Ah!&mdash;Nöjd, have you taken all the
      cartridges out of the guns and pouches?
    </p>
    <p>
      NÖJD. Yes, Ma'am.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Good, wait outside while I answer the Colonel's letter. [Nöjd goes.
      Laura writes.]
    </p>
    <p>
      NURSE. Listen. What in the world is he doing up there now?
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Be quiet while I write.
    </p>
    <p>
      [The sound of sawing is heard.]
    </p>
    <p>
      NURSE [Half to herself]. Oh, God have mercy on us all! Where will this
      end!
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Here, give this to Nöjd. And my mother must not know anything about
      all this. Do you hear?
    </p>
    <p>
      [Nurse goes out, Laura opens drawers in desk and takes out papers. The
      Pastor comes in, he takes a chair and sits near Laura by the desk.]
    </p>
    <p>
      PASTOR. Good evening, sister. I have been away all day, as you know, and
      only just got back. Terrible things have been happening here.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Yes, brother, never have I gone through such a night and such a
      day.
    </p>
    <p>
      PASTOR. I see that you are none the worse for it all.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. No, God be praised, but think what might have happened!
    </p>
    <p>
      PASTOR. Tell me one thing, how did it begin? I have heard so many
      different versions.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. It began with his wild idea of not being Bertha's father, and ended
      with his throwing the lighted lamp in my face.
    </p>
    <p>
      PASTOR. But this is dreadful! It is fully developed insanity. And what is
      to be done now?
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. We must try to prevent further violence and the doctor has sent to
      the hospital for a straightjacket. In the meantime I have sent a message
      to the Colonel, and I am now trying to straighten out the affairs of the
      household, which he has carried on in a most reprehensible manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      PASTOR. This is a deplorable story, but I have always expected something
      of the sort. Fire and powder must end in an explosion. What have you got
      in the drawer there?
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA [Has pulled out a drawer in the desk]. Look, he has hidden
      everything here.
    </p>
    <p>
      PASTOR [Looking into drawer]. Good Heavens, here is your doll and here is
      your christening cap and Bertha's rattle; and your letters; and the
      locket. [Wipes his eyes.] After all he must have loved you very dearly,
      Laura. I never kept such things!
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. I believe he used to love me, but time&mdash;time changes so many
      things.
    </p>
    <p>
      PASTOR. What is that big paper? The receipt for a grave! Yes, better the
      grave than the lunatic asylum! Laura, tell me, are you blameless in all
      this?
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. I? Why should I be to blame because a man goes out of his mind?
    </p>
    <p>
      PASTOR. Well, well, I shan't say anything. After all, blood is thicker
      than water.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. What do you dare to intimate?
    </p>
    <p>
      PASTOR [Looking at her penetratingly]. Now, listen!
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Yes?
    </p>
    <p>
      PASTOR. You can hardly deny that it suits you pretty well to be able to
      educate your child as you wish?
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. I don't understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      PASTOR. How I admire you!
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Me? H'm!
    </p>
    <p>
      PASTOR. And I am to become the guardian of that free-thinker! Do you know
      I have always looked on him as a weed in our garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Laura gives a short laugh, and then becomes suddenly serious.]
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. And you dare say that to me&mdash;his wife?
    </p>
    <p>
      PASTOR. You are strong, Laura, incredibly strong. You are like a fox in a
      trap, you would rather gnaw off your own leg than let yourself be caught!
      Like a master thief&mdash;no accomplice, not even your own conscience.
      Look at yourself in the glass! You dare not!
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. I never use a looking glass!
    </p>
    <p>
      PASTOR. No, you dare not! Let me look at your hand. Not a tell-tale blood
      stain, not a trace of insidious poison! A little innocent murder that the
      law cannot reach, an unconscious crime&mdash;unconscious! What a splendid
      idea! Do you hear how he is working up there? Take care! If that man gets
      loose he will make short work of you.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. You talk so much, you must have a bad conscience. Accuse me if you
      can!
    </p>
    <p>
      PASTOR. I cannot.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. You see! You cannot, and therefore I am innocent. You take care of
      your ward, and I will take care of mine! Here's the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Doctor comes in.]
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA [Rising]. Good evening, Doctor. You at least will help me, won't
      you? But unfortunately there is not much that can be done. Do you hear how
      he is carrying on up there? Are you convinced now?
    </p>
    <p>
      DOCTOR. I am convinced that an act of violence has been committed, but the
      question now is whether that act of violence can be considered an outbreak
      of passion or madness.
    </p>
    <p>
      PASTOR. But apart from the actual outbreak, you must acknowledge that he
      has "fixed ideas."
    </p>
    <p>
      DOCTOR. I think that your ideas, Pastor, are much more fixed.
    </p>
    <p>
      PASTOR. My settled views about the highest things are&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      DOCTOR. We'll leave settled views out of this. Madam, it rests with you to
      decide whether your husband is guilty to the extent of imprisonment and
      fine or should be put in an asylum! How do you class his behavior?
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. I cannot answer that now.
    </p>
    <p>
      DOCTOR. That is to say you have no decided opinion as to what will be most
      advantageous to the interests of the family? What do you say, Pastor?
    </p>
    <p>
      PASTOR. Well, there will be a scandal in either case. It is not easy to
      say.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. But if he is only sentenced to a fine for violence, he will be able
      to repeat the violence.
    </p>
    <p>
      DOCTOR. And if he is sent to prison he will soon be out again. Therefore
      we consider it most advantageous for all parties that he should be
      immediately treated as insane. Where is the nurse?
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Why?
    </p>
    <p>
      DOCTOR. She must put the straightjacket on the patient when I have talked
      to him and given the order! But not before. I have&mdash;the&mdash;garment
      out here. [Goes out into the hall rind returns with a large bundle.]
      Please ask the nurse to come in here.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Laura rings.]
    </p>
    <p>
      PASTOR. Dreadful! Dreadful!
    </p>
    <p>
      [Nurse comes in.]
    </p>
    <p>
      DOCTOR [Takes out the straightjacket]. I want you to pay attention to
      this. We want you to slip this jacket on the Captain, from behind, you
      understand, when I find it necessary to prevent another outbreak of
      violence. You notice it has very long sleeves to prevent his moving and
      they are to be tied at the back. Here are two straps that go through
      buckles which are afterwards fastened to the arm of a chair or the sofa or
      whatever is convenient. Will you do it?
    </p>
    <p>
      NURSE. No, Doctor, I can't do that; I can't.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Why don't you do it yourself, Doctor?
    </p>
    <p>
      DOCTOR. Because the patient distrusts me. You, Madam, would seem to be the
      one to do it, but I fear he distrusts even you.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Laura's face changes for an instant.]
    </p>
    <p>
      DOCTOR. Perhaps you, Pastor&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      PASTOR. No, I must ask to be excused.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Nöjd comes in.]
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Have you delivered the message already?
    </p>
    <p>
      NÖJD. Yes, Madam.
    </p>
    <p>
      DOCTOR. Oh, is it you, Nöjd? You know the circumstances here; you know
      that the Captain is out of his mind and you must help us to take care of
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      NÖJD. If there is anything I can do for the Captain, you may be sure I
      will do it.
    </p>
    <p>
      DOCTOR. You must put this jacket on him&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      NURSE. No, he shan't touch him. Nöjd might hurt him. I would rather do it
      myself, very, very gently. But Nöjd can wait outside and help me if
      necessary. He can do that.
    </p>
    <p>
      [There is loud knocking on the private door.]
    </p>
    <p>
      DOCTOR. There he is! Put the jacket under your shawl on the chair, and you
      must all go out for the time being and the Pastor and I will receive him,
      for that door will not hold out many minutes. Now go.
    </p>
    <p>
      NURSE [Going out left.] The Lord help us!
    </p>
    <p>
      [Laura locks desk, then goes out left. Nöjd goes out back. After a moment
      the private door is forced open, with such violence that the lock is
      broken and the chair is thrown into the middle of the room. The Captain
      comes in with a pile of books under his arm, which he puts on the table.]
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. The whole thing is to be read here, in every book. So I wasn't
      out of my mind after all! Here it is in the Odyssey, book first, verse
      215, page 6 of the Upsala translation. It is Telemachus speaking to
      Athene. "My mother indeed maintains that he, Odysseus, is my father, but I
      myself know it not, for no man yet hath known his own origin." And this
      suspicion is harbored by Telemachus about Penelope, the most virtuous of
      women! Beautiful, eh? And here we have the prophet Ezekiel: "The fool
      saith; behold here is my father, but who can tell whose loins engendered
      him." That's quite clear! And what have we here? The History of Russian
      Literature by Mersläkow. Alexander Puschkin, Russia's greatest poet, died
      of torture front the reports circulated about his wife's unfaithfulness
      rather than by the bullet in his breast, from a duel. On his death-bed he
      swore she was innocent. Ass, ass! How could he swear to it? You see, I
      read my books. Ah, Jonas, art you here? and the doctor, naturally. Have
      you heard what I answered when an English lady complained about Irishmen
      who used to throw lighted lamps in their wives' faces? "God, what women,"
      I cried. "Women," she gasped. "Yes, of course," I answered. "When things
      go so far that a man, a man who loved and worshipped a woman, takes a
      lighted lamp and throws it in her face, then one may know."
    </p>
    <p>
      PASTOR. Know what?
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Nothing. One never knows anything. One only believes. Isn't that
      true, Jonas? One believes and then one is saved! Yes, to be sure. No, I
      know that one can be damned by his faith. I know that.
    </p>
    <p>
      DOCTOR. Captain!
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Silence! I don't want to talk to you; I won't listen to you
      repeating their chatter in there, like a telephone! In there! You know!
      Look here, Jonas; do you believe that you are the father of your children?
      I remember that you had a tutor in your house who had a handsome face, and
      the people gossiped about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      PASTOR. Adolf, take care!
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Grope under your toupee and feel if there are not two bumps
      there. By my soul, I believe he turns pale! Yes, yes, they will talk; but,
      good Lord, they talk so much. Still we are a lot of ridiculous dupes, we
      married men. Isn't that true, Doctor? How was it with your marriage bed?
      Didn't you have a lieutenant in the house, eh? Wait a moment and I will
      make a guess&mdash;his name was&mdash;[whispers in the Doctor's ear]. You
      see he turns pale, too! Don't be disturbed. She is dead and buried and
      what is done can't be undone. I knew him well, by the way, and he is now&mdash;look
      at me, Doctor&mdash;No, straight in my eyes&mdash;a major in the cavalry!
      By God, if I don't believe he has horns, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      DOCTOR [Tortured]. Captain, won't you talk about something else?
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Do you see? He immediately wants to talk of something else when I
      mention horns.
    </p>
    <p>
      PASTOR. Do you know, Adolf, that you are insane?
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Yes; I know that well enough. But if I only had the handling of
      your illustrious brains for awhile I'd soon have you shut up, too! I am
      mad, but how did I become so? That doesn't concern you, and it doesn't
      concern anyone. But you want to talk of something else now. [Takes the
      photograph album from the table.] Good Lord, that is my child! Mine? We
      can never know. Do you know what we would have to do to make sure? First,
      one should marry to get the respect of society, then be divorced soon
      after and become lovers, and finally adopt the children. Then one would at
      least be sure that they were one's adopted children. Isn't that right? But
      how can all that help us now? What can keep me now that you have taken my
      conception of immortality from me, what use is science and philosophy to
      me when I have nothing to live for, what can I do with life when I am
      dishonored? I grafted my right arm, half my brain, half my marrow on
      another trunk, for I believed they would knit themselves together and grow
      into a more perfect tree, and then someone came with a knife and cut below
      the graft, and now I am only half a tree. But the other half goes on
      growing with my arm and half my brain, while I wither and die, for they
      were the best parts I gave away. Now I want to die. Do with me as you
      will. I am no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Buries his head on his arms on table. The Doctor whispers to the Pastor,
      and they go out through the door left. Soon after Bertha comes in.]
    </p>
    <p>
      BERTRA [Goes up to Captain]. Are you ill, Father?
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN [Looks up dazed]. I?
    </p>
    <p>
      BERTHA. Do you know what you have done? Do you know that you threw the
      lamp at Mother?
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Did I?
    </p>
    <p>
      BERTHA. Yes, you did. Just think if she had been hurt.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. What would that have mattered?
    </p>
    <p>
      BERTHA. You are not my father when you talk like that.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. What do you say? Am I not your father? How do you know that? Who
      told you that? And who is your father, then? Who?
    </p>
    <p>
      BERTHA. Not you at any rate.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Still not I? Who, then? Who? You seem to be well informed. Who
      told you? That I should live to see my child come and tell me to my face
      that I am not her father! But don't you know that you disgrace your mother
      when you say that? Don't you know that it is to her shame if it is so?
    </p>
    <p>
      BERTHA. Don't say anything bad about Mother; do you hear?
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. No; you hold together, every one of you, against me! and you have
      always done so.
    </p>
    <p>
      BERTHA. Father!
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Don't use that word again!
    </p>
    <p>
      BERTHA. Father, father!
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN [Draws her to him]. Bertha, dear, dear child, you are my child!
      Yes, Yes; it cannot be otherwise. It is so. The other was only sickly
      thoughts that come with the wind like pestilence and fever. Look at me
      that I may see my soul in your eyes!&mdash;But I see her soul, too! You
      have two souls and you love me with one and hate me with the other. But
      you must only love me! You must have only one soul, or you will never have
      peace, nor I either. You must have only one mind, which is the child of my
      mind and one will, which is my will.
    </p>
    <p>
      BERTHA. But I don't want to, I want to be myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. You must not. You see, I am a cannibal, and I want to eat you.
      Your mother wanted to eat me, but she was not allowed to. I am Saturn who
      ate his children because it had been prophesied that they would eat him.
      To eat or be eaten! That is the question. If I do not eat you, you will
      eat me, and you have already shown your teeth! But don't be frightened my
      dear child; I won't harm you. [Goes and takes a revolver from the wall.]
    </p>
    <p>
      BERTHA [Trying to escape]. Help, Mother, help, he wants to kill me.
    </p>
    <p>
      NURSE [Comes in]. Mr. Adolf, what is it?
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN [Examining revolver]. Have you taken out the cartridges?
    </p>
    <p>
      NURSE. Yes, I put them away when I was tidying up, but sit down and be
      quiet and I'll get them out again!
    </p>
    <p>
      [She takes the Captain by the arm and gets him into a chair, into which he
      sinks feebly. Then she takes out the straitjacket and goes behind the
      chair. Bertha slips out left.]
    </p>
    <p>
      NURSE. Mr. Adolf, do you remember when you were my dear little boy and I
      tucked you in at night and used to repeat: "God who holds his children
      dear" to you, and do you remember how I used to get up in the night and
      give you a drink, how I would light the candle and tell you stories when
      you had bad dreams and couldn't sleep? Do you remember all that?
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Go on talking, Margret, it soothes my head so. Tell me some more.
    </p>
    <p>
      NURSE. O yes, but you must listen then! Do you remember when you took the
      big kitchen knife and wanted to cut out boats with it, and how I came in
      and had to get the knife away by fooling you? You were just a little child
      who didn't understand, so I had to fool you, for you didn't know that it
      was for your own good. "Give me that snake," I said, "or it will bite
      you!" and then you let go of the knife. [Takes the revolver out of the
      Captain's hand.] And then when you had to be dressed and didn't want to, I
      had to coax you and say that you should have a coat of gold and be dressed
      like a prince. And then I took your little blouse that was just made of
      green wool and held it in front of you and said: "In with both arms," and
      then I said, "Now sit nice and still while I button it down the back,"
      [She puts the straightjacket on] and then I said, "Get up now, and walk
      across the floor like a good boy so I can see how it fits." [She leads him
      to the sofa.] And then I said, "Now you must go to bed."
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. What did you say? Was I to go to bed when I was dressed&mdash;damnation!
      what have you done to me? [Tries to get free.] Ah! you cunning devil of a
      woman! Who would have thought you had so much wit. [Lies down on sofa.]
      Trapped, shorn, outwitted, and not to be able to die!
    </p>
    <p>
      NURSE. Forgive me, Mr. Adolf, forgive me, but I wanted to keep you from
      killing your child.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Why didn't you let me? You say life is hell and death the kingdom
      of heaven, and children belong to heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      NURSE. How do you know what comes after death?
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. That is the only thing we do know, but of life we know nothing!
      Oh, if one had only known from the beginning.
    </p>
    <p>
      NURSE. Mr. Adolf, humble your hard heart and cry to God for mercy; it is
      not yet too late. It was not too late for the thief on the cross, when the
      Saviour said, "Today shalt thou be with me in Paradise."
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Are you croaking for a corpse already, you old crow?
    </p>
    <p>
      [Nurse takes a hymnbook out of her pocket.]
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN [Calls]. Nöjd, is Nöjd out there?
    </p>
    <p>
      [Nöjd comes in.]
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Throw this woman out! She wants to suffocate me with her
      hymn-book. Throw her out of the window, or up the chimney, or anywhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      NÖJD. [Looks at Nurse]. Heaven help you, Captain, but I can't do that, I
      can't. If it were only six men, but a woman!
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Can't you manage one woman, eh?
    </p>
    <p>
      NÖJD. Of course I can,&mdash;but&mdash;well, you see, it's queer, but one
      never wants to lay hands on a woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Why not? Haven't they laid hands on me?
    </p>
    <p>
      NÖJD. Yes, but I can't, Captain. It's just as if you asked me to strike
      the Pastor. It's second nature, like religion, I can't!
    </p>
    <p>
      [Laura comes in, she motions Nöjd to go.]
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Omphale, Omphale! Now you play with the club while Hercules spins
      your wool.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA [Goes to sofa]. Adolf, look at me. Do you believe that I am your
      enemy?
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Yes, I do. I believe that you are all my enemies! My mother was
      my enemy when she did not want to bring me into the world because I was to
      be born with pain, and she robbed my embryonic life of its nourishment,
      and made a weakling of me. My sister was my enemy when she taught me that
      I must be submissive to her. The first woman I embraced was my enemy, for
      she gave me ten years of illness in return for the love I gave her. My
      daughter became my enemy when she had to choose between me and you. And
      you, my wife, you have been my arch enemy, because you never let up on me
      till I lay here lifeless.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. I don't know that. I ever thought or even intended what you think I
      did. It may be that a dim desire to get rid of you as an obstacle lay at
      the bottom of it, and if you see any design in my behavior, it is possible
      that it existed, although I was unconscious of it. I have never thought
      how it all came about, but it is the result of the course you yourself
      laid out, and before God and my conscience I feel that I am innocent, even
      if I am not. Your existence has lain like a stone on my heart&mdash;lain
      so heavily that I tried to shake off the oppressive burden. This is the
      truth, and if I have unconsciously struck you down, I ask your
      forgiveness.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. All that sounds plausible. But how does it help me? And whose
      fault is it? Perhaps spiritual marriages! Formerly one married a wife,
      now, one enters into partnership with a business woman, or goes to live
      with a friend&mdash;and then one ruins the partner, and dishonors the
      friend!&mdash;What has become of love, healthy sensuous love? It died in
      the transformation. And what is the result of this love in shares, payable
      to the bearer without joint liability? Who is the bearer when the crash
      comes? Who is the fleshly father of the spiritual child?
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. And as for your suspicions about the child, they are absolutely
      groundless.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. That's just what makes it so horrible. If at least there were any
      grounds for them, it would be something to get hold of, to cling to. Now
      there are only shadows that hide themselves in the bushes, and stick out
      their heads and grin; it is like fighting with the air, or firing blank
      cartridges in a sham fight. A fatal reality would have called forth
      resistance, stirred life and soul to action; but now my thoughts dissolve
      into air, and my brain grinds a void until it is on fire.&mdash;Put a
      pillow under my head, and throw something over me, I am cold. I am
      terribly cold!
    </p>
    <p>
      [Laura takes her shawl and spreads it over him. Nurse goes to get a
      pillow.]
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Give me your hand, friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. My band! The hand that you have bound! Omphale! Omphale!&mdash;But
      I feel your shawl against my mouth; it is as warm and soft as your arm,
      and it smells of vanilla, like your hair when you were young! Laura, when
      you were young, and we walked in the birch woods, with the primroses and
      the thrushes&mdash;glorious, glorious! Think how beautiful life was, and
      what it is now. You didn't want to have it like this, nor did I, and yet
      it happened. Who then rules over life?
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. God alone rules&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. The God of strife then! Or the Goddess perhaps, nowadays.&mdash;Take
      away the cat that is lying on me! Take it away!
    </p>
    <p>
      [Nurse brings in a pillow and takes the shawl away.]
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. Give me my army coat!&mdash;Throw it over me! [Nurse gets the
      coat and puts it over him.] Ah, my rough lion skin that, you wanted to
      take away from me! Omphale! Omphale! You cunning woman, champion of peace
      and contriver of man's disarmament. Wake, Hercules, before they take your
      club away from you! You would wile our armor from us too, and make believe
      that it is nothing but glittering finery. No, it was iron, let me tell
      you, before it ever glittered. In olden days the smith made the armor, now
      it is the needle woman. Omphale! Omphale! Rude strength has fallen before
      treacherous weakness. Out on you infernal woman, and damnation on your
      sex! [He raises himself to spit but falls back on the sofa.] What have you
      given me for a pillow, Margret? It is so hard, and so cold, so cold. Come
      and sit near me. There. May I put my head on your knee? So!&mdash;This is
      warm! Bend over me so that I can feel your breast! Oh, it is sweet to
      sleep against a woman's breast, a mother's, or a mistress's, but the
      mother's is sweetest.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Would you like to see your child, Adolf?
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. My child? A man has no children, it is only woman who has
      children, and therefore the future is hers when we die childless. Oh, God,
      who holds his children dear!
    </p>
    <p>
      NURSE. Listen, he is praying to God.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN. No, to you to put me to sleep, for I am tired, so tired. Good
      night, Margret, and blessed be you among women.
    </p>
    <p>
      [He raises himself, but falls with a cry on the nurses's lap. Laura goes
      to left and calls the Doctor who comes in with the Pastor.]
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Help us, Doctor, if it isn't too late. Look, he has stopped
      breathing.
    </p>
    <p>
      DOCTOR [Feels the Captain's pulse.] It is a stroke.
    </p>
    <p>
      PASTOR. Is he dead?
    </p>
    <p>
      DOCTOR. No, he may yet cone back to life, but to what an awakening we
      cannot tell.
    </p>
    <p>
      PASTOR. "First death, and then the judgment."
    </p>
    <p>
      DOCTOR. No judgment, and no accusations, you who believe that a God shapes
      man's destiny must go to him about this.
    </p>
    <p>
      NURSE. Ah, Pastor, with his last breath he prayed to God.
    </p>
    <p>
      PASTOR [To Laura]. Is that true?
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. It is.
    </p>
    <p>
      DOCTOR. In that case, which I can understand as little as the cause of his
      illness, my skill is at an end. You try yours now, Pastor.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. Is that all you have to say at this death-bed, Doctor?
    </p>
    <p>
      DOCTOR. That is all! I know no more. Let him speak who knows more.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Bertha comes in from left and runs to her mother.]
    </p>
    <p>
      BERTHA. Mother, Mother!
    </p>
    <p>
      LAURA. My child, my own child!
    </p>
    <p>
      PASTOR. Amen.

     COUNTESS JULIE, twenty-five years old
     JEAN, a valet, thirty
     KRISTIN, a cook, thirty-five
     FARM SERVANTS
</pre>
    <p>
      The action takes place on Saint John's night, the mid-summer festival
      surviving from pagan times.
    </p>
    <p>
      [SCENE.&mdash;A large kitchen. The ceiling and walls are partially covered
      by draperies and greens. The back wall slants upward from left side of
      scene. On back wall, left, are two shelves filled with copper kettles,
      iron casseroles and tin pans. The shelves are trimmed with fancy scalloped
      paper. To right of middle a large arched entrance with glass doors through
      which one sees a fountain with a statue of Cupid, syringa bushes in bloom
      and tall poplars. To left corner of scene a large stove with hood
      decorated with birch branches. To right, servants' dining table of white
      pine and a few chairs. On the end of table stands a Japanese jar filled
      with syringa blossoms. The floor is strewn with juniper branches.]
    </p>
    <p>
      [Near stove, an ice-box, sink and dish-table. A large old-fashioned bell,
      hangs over the door, to left of door a speaking tube.]
    </p>
    <p>
      [Kristin stands at stove engaged in cooking something. She wears a light
      cotton dress and kitchen apron. Jean comes in wearing livery; he carries a
      large pair of riding-boots with spurs, which he puts on floor.]
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. Tonight Miss Julie is crazy again, perfectly crazy.
    </p>
    <p>
      KRISTIN. So&mdash;you're back at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. I went to the station with the Count and coming back I went in to
      the barn and danced and then I discovered Miss Julie there leading the
      dance with the gamekeeper. When she spied me, she rushed right toward me
      and asked me to waltz, and then she waltzed so&mdash;never in my life have
      I seen anything like it! Ah&mdash;she is crazy tonight.
    </p>
    <p>
      KRISTIN. She has always been. But never so much as in the last fortnight,
      since her engagement was broken off.
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. Yes, what about that gossip? He seemed like a fine fellow although
      he wasn't rich! Ach! they have so much nonsense about them. [Seats himself
      at table.] It's queer about Miss Julie though&mdash;to prefer staying here
      at home among these people, eh, to going away with her father to visit her
      relatives, eh?
    </p>
    <p>
      KRISTIN. She's probably shamefaced about breaking off with her intended.
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. No doubt! but he was a likely sort just the same. Do you know,
      Kristin, how it happened? I saw it, although I didn't let on.
    </p>
    <p>
      KRISTIN. No&mdash;did you see it?
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. Yes, indeed, I did. They were out in the stable yard one evening and
      she was "training" him as she called it. Do you know what happened? She
      made him leap over her riding whip, the way you teach a dog to jump. He
      jumped it twice and got a lash each time; but the third time he snatched
      the whip from her hand and broke it into pieces. And then he vanished!
    </p>
    <p>
      KRISTIN. Was that the way it happened? No, you don't say so!
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. Yes, that's the way the thing happened. But what have you got to
      give me that's good, Kristin?
    </p>
    <p>
      KRISTIN. [She takes things from the pans on stove and serves them to him.]
      Oh, it's only a bit of kidney that I cut out of the veal steak for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN [Smelling the food]. Splendid! My favorite delicacy. [Feeling of
      plate]. But you might have warmed the plate.
    </p>
    <p>
      KRISTIN. You're fussier than the Count, when you get started. [Tweaks his
      hair.]
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. Don't pull my hair! You know how sensitive I am.
    </p>
    <p>
      KRISTIN. Oh&mdash;there, there! you know I was only loving you.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Jean eats, and Kristin opens bottle of beer.]
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. Beer on midsummer night&mdash;thank you, no! I have something better
      than that myself. [Takes bottle of wine from drawer of table.] Yellow
      seal, how's that? Now give me a glass&mdash;a wine glass you understand,
      of course, when one drinks the genuine.
    </p>
    <p>
      KRISTIN. [Fetches a glass. Then goes to stove and puts on casserole.]
      Heaven help the woman who gets you for her husband. Such a fuss budget!
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. Oh, talk! You ought to be glad to get such a fine fellow as I am.
      And I don't think it's done you any harm because I'm considered your
      intended. [Tastes wine.] Excellent, very excellent! Just a little too
      cold. [Warms glass with hands]. We bought this at Dijon. It stood at four
      francs a litre in the bulk; then of course there was the duty besides.
      What are you cooking now that smells so infernally?
    </p>
    <p>
      KRISTIN. Oh, it's some devil's mess that Miss Julie must have for Diana.
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. Take care of your words, Kristin. But why should you stand there
      cooking for that damned dog on a holiday evening? Is it sick, eh?
    </p>
    <p>
      KRISTIN. Yes, it's sick. Diana sneaked out with the gatekeeper's mongrels
      and now something is wrong. Miss Julie can't stand that.
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. Miss Julie has a great deal of pride about some things&mdash;but not
      enough about others! Just like her mother in her lifetime; she thrived
      best in the kitchen or the stable, but she must always drive tandem&mdash;never
      one horse! She would go about with soiled cuffs but she had to have the
      Count's crest on her cuff buttons. And as for Miss Julie, she doesn't take
      much care of her appearance either. I should say she isn't refined. Why
      just now out there she pulled the forester from Anna's side and asked him
      to dance with her. We wouldn't do things that way. But when the highborn
      wish to unbend they become vulgar. Splendid she is though! Magnificent!
      Ah, such shoulders and&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      KRISTIN. Oh, don't exaggerate. I've heard what Clara says who dresses her
      sometimes, I have.
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. Ha! Clara&mdash;you women are always jealous of each other. I who've
      been out riding with her&mdash;!!! And such a dancer!
    </p>
    <p>
      KRISTIN. Come now, Jean, don't you want to dance with me when I'm through?
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. Of course I want to.
    </p>
    <p>
      KRISTIN. That is a promise?
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. Promise! When I say I will do a thing I do it! Thanks for the supper&mdash;it
      was excellent.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Pushes cork in the bottle with a bang. Miss Julie appears in doorway,
      speaking to someone outside.]
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. I'll be back soon, but don't let things wait for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Jean quickly puts bottle in table drawer and rises very respectfully.]
    </p>
    <p>
      [Enter Miss Julie and goes to Kristin.]
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. Is it done?
    </p>
    <p>
      [Kristin indicating Jean's presence.]
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN [Gallantly]. Have you secrets between you?
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. [Flipping handkerchief in his face]. Curious, are you?
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. How sweet that violet perfume is!
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE [Coquettishly]. Impudence! Do you appreciate perfumes too? Dance&mdash;that
      you can do splendidly. [Jean looks towards the cooking stove]. Don't look.
      Away with you.
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN [Inquisitive but polite]. Is it some troll's dish that you are both
      concocting for midsummer night? Something to pierce the future with and
      evoke the face of your intended?
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE [Sharply]. To see him one must have sharp eyes. [To Kristin]. Put it
      into a bottle and cork it tight. Come now, Jean and dance a schottische
      with me.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Jean hesitates.]
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. I don't wish to be impolite to anyone but&mdash;this dance I
      promised to Kristin.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. Oh, she can have another&mdash;isn't that so, Kristin? Won't you
      lend Jean to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      KRISTIN. It's not for me to say, if Miss Julie is so gracious it's not for
      me to say no. [To Jean]. Go you and be grateful for the honor.
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. Well said&mdash;but not wishing any offense I wonder if it is
      prudent for Miss Julie to dance twice in succession with her servant,
      especially as people are never slow to find meaning in&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE [Breaking out]. In what? What sort of meaning? What were you going
      to say?
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN [Taken aback]. Since Miss Julie does not understand I must speak
      plainly. It may look strange to prefer one of your&mdash;underlings&mdash;to
      others who covet the same honor&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. To prefer&mdash;what a thought! I, the lady of the house! I honor
      the people with my presence and now that I feel like dancing I want to
      have a partner who knows how to lead to avoid being ridiculous.
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. As Miss Julie commands. I'm here to serve.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE [Mildly]. You mustn't look upon that as a command. Tonight we are
      all in holiday spirits&mdash;full of gladness and rank is flung aside. So,
      give me your arm! Don't be alarmed, Kristin, I shall not take your
      sweetheart away from you.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Jean offers arm. They exit.]
    </p>
    <p>
      [PANTOMIME.&mdash;Played as though the actress were really alone. Turns
      her back to the audience when necessary. Does not look out into the
      auditorium. Does not hurry as though fearing the audience might grow
      restless. Soft violin music from the distance, schottische time. Kristin
      hums with the music. She cleans the table; washes plate, wipes it and puts
      it in the china closet. Takes off her apron and then opens drawer of table
      and takes a small hand glass and strands it against a flower pot on table.
      Lights a candle and heats a hair pin with which she crimps her hair around
      her forehead. After that she goes to door at back and listens. Then she
      returns to table and sees the Countess' handkerchief, picks it up, smells
      of it, then smooths it out and folds it. Enter Jean.]
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. She is crazy I tell you! To dance like that! And the people stand
      grinning at her behind the doors. What do you say to that, Kristin?
    </p>
    <p>
      KRISTIN. Oh, didn't I say she's been acting queer lately? But isn't it my
      turn to dance now?
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. You are not angry because I let myself be led by the forelock?
    </p>
    <p>
      KRISTIN. No, not for such a little thing. That you know well enough. And I
      know my place too&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN [Puts arm around her waist]. You're a pretty smart girl, Kristin, and
      you ought to make a good wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Enter Miss Julie.]
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE [Disagreeably surprised, but with forced gaiety]. You're a charming
      cavalier to run away from your partner.
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. On the contrary, Miss Julie, I have hastened to my neglected one as
      you see.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE [Changing subject]. Do you know, you dance wonderfully well! But why
      are you in livery on a holiday night? Take it off immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. Will you excuse me&mdash;my coat hangs there. [Goes R. and takes
      coat.]
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. Does it embarrass you to change your coat in my presence? Go to
      your room then&mdash;or else stay and I'll turn my back.
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. With your permission, Miss Julie.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Exit Jean R. One sees his arm as he changes coat.]
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE [To Kristin]. Is Jean your sweetheart, that he is so devoted?
    </p>
    <p>
      KRISTIN. Sweetheart? Yes, may it please you. Sweetheart&mdash;that's what
      they call it.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. Call it?
    </p>
    <p>
      KRISTIN. Oh Miss Julie has herself had a sweetheart and&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. Yes, we were engaged&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      KRISTIN. But it came to nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Enter Jean in black frock coat.]
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. Tres gentil, Monsieur Jean, tres gentil.
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. Vous voulez plaisanter, Mademoiselle.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. Et vous voulez parler francais? Where did you learn that?
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. In Switzerland where I was butler in the largest hotel at Lucerne.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. Why, you look like a gentleman in your frock coat. Charmant! [Seats
      herself by table.]
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. You flatter me!
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. Flatter! [Picking him up on the word.]
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. My natural modesty forbids me to believe that you could mean these
      pleasant things that you say to a&mdash;such as I am&mdash;and therefore I
      allowed myself to fancy that you overrate or, as it is called, flatter.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. Where did you learn to use words like that? Have you frequented the
      theatres much?
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. I have frequented many places, I have!
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. But you were born here in this neighborhood?
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. My father was a deputy under the public prosecutor, and I saw Miss
      Julie as a child&mdash;although she didn't see me!
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. No, really?
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. Yes, I remember one time in particular. But I mustn't talk about
      that.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. Oh yes, do, when was it?
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. No really&mdash;not now, another time perhaps.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. "Another time" is a good for nothing. Is it so dreadful then?
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. Not dreadful&mdash;but it goes against the grain. [Turns and points
      to Kristin, who has fallen asleep in a chair near stove]. Look at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. She'll make a charming wife! Does she snore too?
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. No, but she talks in her sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE [Cynically]. How do you know that she talks in her sleep?
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN [Boldly]. I have heard her.[Pause and they look at each other.]
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. Why don't you sit down?
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. I can't allow myself to do so in your presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. But if I command you?
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. Then I obey.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. Sit down then. But wait&mdash;can't you get me something to drink
      first?
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. I don't know what there is in the icebox. Nothing but beer,
      probably.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. Is beer nothing? My taste is so simple that I prefer it to wine.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Jean takes out beer and serves it on plate.]
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. Allow me.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. Won't you drink too?
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. I am no friend to beer&mdash;but if Miss Julie commands.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE [Gaily]. Commands! I should think as a polite cavalier you might
      join your lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. Looking at it in that way you are quite right. [Opens another bottle
      of beer and fills glass.]
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. Give me a toast!
    </p>
    <p>
      [Jean hesitates.]
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE [Mockingly]. Old as he is, I believe the man is bashful!
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN [On his knee with mock gallantry, raises glass]. A health to my lady
      of the house!
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. Bravo! Now you must kiss my slipper. Then the thing is perfect.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Jean hesitates and then seizes her foot and kisses it lightly.]
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. Splendid! You should have been an actor.
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN [Rising]. But this mustn't go any further, Miss Julie. What if
      someone should come in and see us?
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. What harm would that do?
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. Simply that it would give them a chance to gossip. And if Miss Julie
      only knew how their tongues wagged just now&mdash;then&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. What did they say? Tell me. And sit down now.
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN [Sitting]. I don't wish to hurt you, but they used an expression&mdash;threw
      hints of a certain kind&mdash;but you are not a child, you can understand.
      When one sees a lady drinking alone with a man&mdash;let alone a servant&mdash;at
      night&mdash;then&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. Then what? And for that matter, we are not alone. Kristin is here.
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. Sleeping! Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. Then I shall wake her. [Rises]. Kristin, are you asleep?
    </p>
    <p>
      KRISTIN. [In her sleep]. Bla&mdash;bla&mdash;bla&mdash;bla.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. Kristin! She certainly can sleep. [Goes to Kristin.]
    </p>
    <p>
      KRISTIN. [In her sleep]. The Count's boots are polished&mdash;put on the
      coffee&mdash;soon&mdash;soon&mdash;soon. Oh&mdash;h-h-h&mdash;puh!
      [Breathes heavily. Julie takes her by the nose.]
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. Won't you wake up?
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN [Sternly]. Don't disturb the sleeping.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE [Sharply]. What?
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. Anyone who has stood over the hot stove all day long is tired when
      night comes. One should respect the weary.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. That's a kind thought&mdash;and I honor it. [Offers her hand.]
      Thanks for the suggestion. Come out with me now and pick some syringas.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Kristin has awakened and goes to her room, right, in a sort of sleep
      stupified way.]
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. With Miss Julie?
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. With me.
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. But that wouldn't do&mdash;decidedly not.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. I don't understand you. Is it possible that you fancy that I&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. No&mdash;not I, but people.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. What? That I'm in love with my coachman?
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. I am not presumptuous, but we have seen instances&mdash;and with the
      people nothing is sacred.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. I believe he is an aristocrat!
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. Yes, I am.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. But I step down&mdash; &mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. Don't step down, Miss Julie. Listen to me&mdash;no one would believe
      that you stepped down of your own accord; people always say that one falls
      down.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. I think better of the people than you do. Come&mdash;and try them&mdash;come!
    </p>
    <p>
      [Dares him with a look.]
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. Do you know that you are wonderful?
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. Perhaps. But you are too. Everything is wonderful for that matter.
      Life, people&mdash;everything. Everything is wreckage, that drifts over
      the water until it sinks, sinks. I have the same dream every now and then
      and at this moment I am reminded of it. I find myself seated at the top of
      a high pillar and I see no possible way to get down. I grow dizzy when I
      look down, but down I must. But I'm not brave enough to throw myself; I
      cannot hold fast and I long to fall&mdash;but I don't fall. And yet I can
      find no rest or peace until I shall come down to earth; and if I came down
      to earth I would wish myself down in the ground. Have you ever felt like
      that?
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. No, I dream that I'm lying in a dark wood under a tall tree and I
      would up&mdash;up to the top, where I can look far over the fair
      landscape, where the sun is shining. I climb&mdash;climb, to plunder the
      birds' nests up there where the golden eggs lie, but the tree trunk is so
      thick, so smooth, and the first limb is so high! But I know if I reached
      the first limb I should climb as though on a ladder, to the top. I haven't
      reached it yet, but I shall reach it, if only in the dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. Here I stand talking about dreams with you. Come now, just out in
      the park.
    </p>
    <p>
      [She offers her arm and they start.]
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. We should sleep on nine midsummer flowers tonight and then our
      dreams would come true.
    </p>
    <p>
      [She turns, Jean quickly holds a hand over his eye.]
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. What is it, something in your eye?
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. Oh, it is nothing&mdash;just a speck. It will be all right in a
      moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. It was some dust from my sleeve that brushed against you. Now sit
      down and let me look for it. [Pulls him into a chair, looks into his eye.]
      Now sit still, perfectly still. [Uses corner of her handkerchief in his
      eye. Strikes his hand.] So&mdash;will you mind? I believe you are
      trembling, strong man that you are. [Touching his arm.] And such arms!
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN [Warningly.] Miss Julie!
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. Yes, Monsieur Jean!
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. Attention. Je ne suis qu'un homme!
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. Will you sit still! So, now it is gone! Kiss my hand and thank me!
    </p>
    <p>
      [Jean rises.]
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. Miss Julie, listen to me. Kristin has gone to bed now&mdash;will you
      listen to me&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. Kiss my hand first.
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. Listen to me&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. Kiss my hand first.
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. Yes, but blame yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. For what?
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. For what? Are you a child at twenty-five? Don't you know that it is
      dangerous to play with fire?
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. Not for me. I am insured!
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. No, you are not. But even if you are, there is inflammable material
      in the neighborhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. Might that be you?
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. Yes, not because it is I, but because I'm a young man&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE [Scornfully]. With a grand opportunity&mdash;what inconceivable
      presumption! A Don Juan perhaps! Or a Joseph! On my soul, I believe he is
      a Joseph!
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. You do?
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. Almost.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Jean rushes towards her and tries to take her in his arms to kiss her.]
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE [Gives him a box on the ear]. Shame on you.
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. Are you in earnest, or fooling?
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. In earnest.
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. Then you were in earnest a moment ago, too. You play too seriously
      with what is dangerous. Now I'm tired of playing and beg to be excused
      that I may go on with my work. The Count must have his boots in time, and
      it is long past midnight. [Jean picks up boots.]
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. Put those boots away.
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. No, that is my work which it is my duty to do, but I was not hired
      to be your play thing and that I shall never be. I think too well of
      myself for that.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. You are proud.
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. In some things&mdash;not in others.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. Were you ever in love?
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. We do not use that word, but I have liked many girls. One time I was
      sick because I couldn't have the one I wanted&mdash;sick, you understand,
      like the princesses in the Arabian Nights who could not eat nor drink for
      love sickness.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. Who was she? [Jean is silent.] Who was she?
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. That you could not make me tell.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. Not if I ask you as an equal, as a&mdash;friend? Who was she?
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. It was you!
    </p>
    <p>
      [Julie seats herself.]
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. How extravagant!
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. Yes, if you will, it was ridiculous. That was the story I hesitated
      to tell, but now I'm going to tell it. Do you know how people in high life
      look from the under world? No, of course you don't. They look like hawks
      and eagles whose backs one seldom sees, for they soar up above. I lived in
      a hovel provided by the state, with seven brothers and sisters and a pig;
      out on a barren stretch where nothing grew, not even a tree, but from the
      window I could see the Count's park walls with apple trees rising above
      them. That was the garden of paradise; and there stood many angry angels
      with flaming swords protecting it; but for all that I and other boys found
      the way to the tree of life&mdash;now you despise me.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. Oh, all boys steal apples.
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. You say that, but you despise me all the same. No matter! One time I
      entered the garden of paradise&mdash;it was to weed the onion beds with my
      mother! Near the orchard stood a Turkish pavilion, shaded and overgrown
      with jessamine and honeysuckle. I didn't know what it was used for and I
      had never seen anything so beautiful. People passed in and out and one day&mdash;the
      door was left open. I sneaked in and beheld walls covered with pictures of
      kings and emperors and there were red-fringed curtains at the windows&mdash;now
      you understand what I mean&mdash;I&mdash;[Breaks off a spray of syringes
      and puts it to her nostrils.] I had never been in the castle and how my
      thoughts leaped&mdash;and there they returned ever after. Little by little
      the longing came over me to experience for once the pleasure of&mdash;enfin,
      I sneaked in and was bewildered. But then I heard someone coming&mdash;there
      was only one exit for the great folk, but for me there was another, and I
      had to choose that. [Julie who has taken the syringa lets it fall on
      table.] Once out I started to run, scrambled through a raspberry hedge,
      rushed over a strawberry bed and came to a stop on the rose terrace. For
      there I saw a figure in a white dress and white slippers and stockings&mdash;it
      was you! I hid under a heap of weeds, under, you understand, where the
      thistles pricked me, and lay on the damp, rank earth. I gazed at you
      walking among the roses. And I thought if it is true that the thief on the
      cross could enter heaven and dwell among the angels it was strange that a
      pauper child on God's earth could not go into the castle park and play
      with the Countess' daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE [Pensively]. Do you believe that all poor children would have such
      thoughts under those conditions?
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN [Hesitates, then in a positive voice]. That all poor children&mdash;yes,
      of course, of course!
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. It must be a terrible misfortune to be poor.
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN [With deep pain and great chagrin]. Oh, Miss Julie, a dog may lie on
      the couch of a Countess, a horse may be caressed by a lady's hand, but a
      servant&mdash;yes, yes, sometimes there is stuff enough in a man, whatever
      he be, to swing himself up in the world, but how often does that happen!
      But to return to the story, do you know what I did? I ran down to the mill
      dam and threw myself in with my clothes on&mdash;and was pulled out and
      got a thrashing. But the following Sunday when all the family went to
      visit my grandmother I contrived to stay at home; I scrubbed myself well,
      put on my best clothes, such as they were, and went to church so that I
      might see you. I saw you. Then I went home with my mind made up to put an
      end to myself. But I wanted to do it beautifully and without pain. Then I
      happened to remember that elderberry blossoms are poisonous. I knew where
      there was a big elderberry bush in full bloom and I stripped it of its
      riches and made a bed of it in the oat-bin. Have you ever noticed how
      smooth and glossy oats are? As soft as a woman's arm.&mdash;Well, I got in
      and let down the cover, fell asleep, and when I awoke I was very ill, but
      didn't die&mdash;as you see. What I wanted&mdash;I don't know. You were
      unattainable, but through the vision of you I was made to realize how
      hopeless it was to rise above the conditions of my birth.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. You tell it well! Were you ever at school?
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. A little, but I have read a good deal and gone to the theatres. And
      besides, I have always heard the talk of fine folks and from them I have
      learned most.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. Do you listen then to what we are saying?
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. Yes, indeed, I do. And I have heard much when I've been on the
      coachbox. One time I heard Miss Julie and a lady&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. Oh, what was it you heard?
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. Hm! that's not so easy to tell. But I was astonished and could not
      understand where you had heard such things. Well, perhaps at bottom
      there's not so much difference between people and&mdash;people.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. Oh, shame! We don't behave as you do when we are engaged.
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. [Eyeing her]. Are you sure of that? It isn't worthwhile to play the
      innocent with me.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. I gave my love to a rascal.
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. That's what they always say afterward.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. Always?
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. Always, I believe, as I have heard the expression many times before
      under the same circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. What circumstances?
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. Those we've been talking about. The last time I&mdash; &mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. Silence. I don't wish to hear any more.
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. Well, then I beg to be excused so I may go to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. Go to bed! On midsummer night?
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. Yes, for dancing out there with that pack has not amused me.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. Then get the key for the boat and row me out over the lake. I want
      to see the sun rise.
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. Is that prudent?
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. One would think that you were afraid of your reputation.
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. Why not? I don't want to be made ridiculous. I am not willing to be
      driven out without references, now that I am going to settle down. And I
      feel I owe something to Kristin.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. Oh, so it's Kristin now&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. Yes, but you too. Take my advice, go up and go to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. Shall I obey you?
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. For once&mdash;for your own sake. I beg of you. Night is crawling
      along, sleepiness makes one irresponsible and the brain grows hot. Go to
      your room. In fact&mdash;if I hear rightly some of the people are coming
      for me. If they find us here&mdash;then you are lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Chorus is heard approaching, singing.]
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
      "There came two ladies out of the woods
       Tridiridi-ralla tridiridi-ra.
       One of them had wet her foot,
       Tridiridi-ralla-la.

      "They talked of a hundred dollars,
       Tridiridi-ralla tridiridi-ra.
       But neither had hardly a dollar,
       Tridiridi-ralla-la.

      "The mitten I'm going to send you,
       Tridirichi-ralla tridiridi-ra.
       For another I'm going to jilt you,
       Tridiridi-ralla tridiridi-ra."
</pre>
    <p>
      JULIE. I know the people and I love them and they respect me. Let them
      come, you shall see.
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. No, Miss Julie, they don't love you. They take your food and spit
      upon your kindness, believe me. Listen to them, listen to what they're
      singing! No! Don't listen!
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE [Listening]. What are they singing?
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. It's something suggestive, about you and me.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. Infamous! Oh horrible! And how cowardly!
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. The pack is always cowardly. And in such a battle one can only run
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. Run away? Where? We can't get out and we can't go to Kristin.
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. Into my room then. Necessity knows no law. You can depend on me for
      I am your real, genuine, respectful friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. But think if they found you there.
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. I will turn the key and if they try to break in I'll shoot. Come&mdash;come!
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. [Meaningly]. You promise me&mdash;?
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. I swear...
    </p>
    <p>
      [She exits R. Jean follows her.]
    </p>
    <p>
      [BALLET.&mdash;The farm folk enter in holiday dress with flowers in their
      hats, a fiddler in the lead. They carry a keg of home-brewed beer and a
      smaller keg of gin, both decorated with greens which are placed on the
      table. They help themselves to glasses and drink. Then they sing and dance
      a country dance to the melody of "There came two ladies out of the woods."
      When that is over they go out, singing.]
    </p>
    <p>
      [Enter Julie alone, sees the havoc the visitors have made, clasps her
      hands, takes out powder box and powders her face. Enter Jean exuberant.]
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. There, you see, and you heard them. Do you think it's possible for
      us to remain here any longer?
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. No, I don't. But what's to be done?
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. Fly! Travel&mdash;far from here!
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. Travel&mdash;yes&mdash;but where?
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. To Switzerland&mdash;to the Italian lakes. You have never been
      there?
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. No&mdash;is it beautiful there?
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. Oh, an eternal summer! Oranges, trees, laurels&mdash;oh!
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. But what shall we do there?
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. I'll open a first-class hotel for first-class patrons.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. Hotel?
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. That is life&mdash;you shall see! New faces constantly, different
      languages. Not a moment for boredom. Always something to do night and day&mdash;the
      bell ringing, the trains whistling, the omnibus coming and going and all
      the time the gold pieces rolling into the till&mdash;that is life!
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. Yes, that is life. And I&mdash;?
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. The mistress of the establishment&mdash;the ornament of the house.
      With your looks&mdash;and your manners&mdash;oh, it's a sure success!
      Colossal! You could sit like a queen in the office and set the slaves in
      action by touching an electric button. The guests line up before your
      throne and shyly lay their riches on your desk. You can't believe how
      people tremble when they get their bills&mdash;I can salt the bills and
      you can sweeten them with your most bewitching smile&mdash;ha, let us get
      away from here&mdash;[Takes a time table from his pocket] immediately&mdash;by
      the next train. We can be at Malmö at 6.30, Hamburg at 8.40 tomorrow
      morning, Frankfort the day after and at Como by the St. Gothard route in
      about&mdash;let me see, three days. Three days!
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. All that is well enough, but Jean&mdash;you must give me courage.
      Take me in your arms and tell me that you love me.
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN [Hesitatingly]. I will&mdash;but I daren't&mdash;not again in this
      house. I love you of course&mdash;do you doubt that?
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE [Shyly and with womanliness]. You! Say thou to me! Between us there
      can be no more formality. Say thou.
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. I can't&mdash;There must be formality between us&mdash;as long as we
      are in this house. There is the memory of the past&mdash;and there is the
      Count, your father. I have never known anyone else for whom I have such
      respect. I need only to see his gloves lying in a chair to feel my own
      insignificance. I have only to hear his bell to start like a nervous horse&mdash;and
      now as I see his boots standing there so stiff and proper I feel like
      bowing and scraping. [Gives boots a kick]. Superstitions and prejudices
      taught in childhood can't be uprooted in a moment. Let us go to a country
      that is a republic where they'll stand on their heads for my coachman's
      livery&mdash;on their heads shall they stand&mdash;but I shall not. I am
      not born to bow and scrape, for there's stuff in me&mdash;character. If I
      only get hold of the first limb, you shall see me climb. I'm a coachman
      today, but next year I shall be a proprietor, in two years a gentleman of
      income; then for Roumania where I'll let them decorate me and can, mark
      you, <i>can</i> end a count!
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. Beautiful, beautiful!
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. Oh, in Roumania, one can buy a title cheap&mdash;and so you can be a
      countess just the same&mdash;my countess!
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. What do I care for all that&mdash;which I now cast behind me. Say
      that you love me&mdash;else, what am I, without it?
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. I'll say it a thousand times afterwards, but not here. Above all,
      let us have no sentimentality now or everything will fall through. We must
      look at this matter coldly like sensible people. [Takes out a cigar and
      lights it.] Now sit down there and I'll sit here and we'll talk it over as
      if nothing had happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE [Staggered]. Oh, my God, have you no feeling?
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. I? No one living has more feeling than I but I can restrain myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. A moment ago you could kiss my slipper and now&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN [Harshly]. That was&mdash;then. Now we have other things to think
      about.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. Don't speak harshly to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. Not harshly, but wisely. One folly has been committed&mdash;commit
      no more. The Count may be here at any moment, and before he comes, our
      fate must be settled. How do my plans for the future strike you? Do you
      approve of them?
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. They seem acceptable enough. But one question. For such a great
      undertaking a large capital is necessary, have you that?
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN [Chewing his cigar]. I? To be sure. I have my regular occupation, my
      unusual experience, my knowledge of different languages&mdash;that is
      capital that counts, I should say.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. But with all that you could not buy a railway ticket.
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. That's true, and for that reason I'm looking for a backer who can
      furnish the funds.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. How can that be done at a moment's notice?
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. That is for you to say, if you wish to be my companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. I can't&mdash;as I have nothing myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      [A pause.]
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. Then the whole matter drops&mdash; &mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. And&mdash; &mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. Things remain as they are.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. Do you think I could remain under this roof after&mdash;&mdash;Do
      you think I will allow the people to point at me in scorn, or that I can
      ever look my father in the face again? Never! Take me away from this
      humiliation and dishonor. Oh, what have I done! Oh, my God, what have I
      done! [Weeping.]
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. So, you are beginning in that tune now. What have you done? The same
      as many before you.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. And now you despise me. I am falling! I am falling!
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. Fall down to my level, I'll lift you up afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. What strange power drew me to you&mdash;the weak to the strong&mdash;the
      falling to the rising, or is this love! This&mdash;love! Do you know what
      love is?
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. I? Yes! Do you think it's the first time?
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. What language, what thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. I am what life has made me. Don't be nervous and play the high and
      mighty, for now we are on the same level. Look here, my little girl, let
      me offer you a glass of something extra fine. [Opens drawer of table and
      takes out wine bottle, then fills two glasses that have been already
      used.]
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. Where did you get that wine?
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. From the cellar.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. My father's Burgundy.
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. What's the matter, isn't that good enough for the son-in-law?
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. And I drink beer&mdash;I!
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. That only goes to prove that your taste is poorer than mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. Thief!
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. Do you intend to tattle?
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. Oh ho! Accomplice to a house thief. Was I intoxicated&mdash;have I
      been walking in my sleep this night&mdash;midsummer night, the night for
      innocent play&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. Innocent, eh!
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE [Pacing back and forth]. Is there a being on earth so miserable as
      I.
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. Why are you, after such a conquest. Think of Kristin in there, don't
      you think she has feelings too?
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. I thought so a little while ago, but I don't any more. A servant is
      a servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. And a whore is a whore.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE [Falls on her knees with clasped hands]. Oh, God in heaven, end my
      wretched life, save me from this mire into which I'm sinking&mdash;Oh save
      me, save me.
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. I can't deny that it hurts me to see you like this.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. And you who wanted to die for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. In the oat-bin? Oh, that was only talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. That is to say&mdash;a lie!
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN [Beginning to show sleepiness]. Er&mdash;er almost. I believe I read
      something of the sort in a newspaper about a chimney-sweep who made a
      death bed for himself of syringa blossoms in a wood-bin&mdash;[laughs]
      because they were going to arrest him for non-support of his children.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. So you are such a&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. What better could I have hit on! One must always be romantic to
      capture a woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. Wretch! Now you have seen the eagle's back, and I suppose I am to
      be the first limb&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. And the limb is rotten&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE [Without seeming to hear]. And I am to be the hotel's signboard&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. And I the hotel&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. And sit behind the desk and allure guests and overcharge them&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. Oh, that'll be my business.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. That a soul can be so degraded!
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. Look to your own soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. Lackey! Servant! Stand up when I speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. Don't you dare to moralize to me. Lackey, eh! Do you think you have
      shown yourself finer than any maid-servant tonight?
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE [Crushed]. That is right, strike me, trample on me, I deserve
      nothing better. I have done wrong, but help me now. Help me out of this if
      there is any possible way.
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN [Softens somewhat]. I don't care to shirk my share of the blame, but
      do you think any one of my position would ever have dared to raise his
      eyes to you if you yourself had not invited it? Even now I am astonished&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. And proud.
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. Why not? Although I must confess that the conquest was too easy to
      be exciting.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. Go on, strike me again&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN [Rising]. No, forgive me, rather, for what I said. I do not strike
      the unarmed, least of all, a woman. But I can't deny that from a certain
      point of view it gives me satisfaction to know that it is the glitter of
      brass, not gold, that dazzles us from below, and that the eagle's back is
      grey like the rest of him. On the other hand, I'm sorry to have to realize
      that all that I have looked up to is not worth while, and it pains me to
      see you fallen lower than your cook as it pains me to see autumn blossoms
      whipped to pieces by the cold rain and transformed into&mdash;dirt!
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. You speak as though you were already my superior.
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. And so I am! For I can make you a countess and you could never make
      me a count.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. But I am born of a count, that you can never be.
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. That is true, but I can be the father of counts&mdash;if&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. But you are a thief&mdash;that I am not.
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. There are worse things than that, and for that matter when I serve
      in a house I regard myself as a member of the family, a child of the house
      as it were. And one doesn't consider it theft if children snoop a berry
      from full bushes. [With renewed passion]. Miss Julie, you are a glorious
      woman&mdash;too good for such as I. You have been the victim of an
      infatuation and you want to disguise this fault by fancying that you love
      me. But you do not&mdash;unless perhaps my outer self attracts you. And
      then your love is no better than mine. But I cannot be satisfied with
      that, and your real love I can never awaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. Are you sure of that?
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. You mean that we could get along with such an arrangement? There's
      no doubt about my loving you&mdash;you are beautiful, you are elegant&mdash;[Goes
      to her and takes her hand] accomplished, lovable when you wish to be, and
      the flame that you awaken in man does not die easily. [Puts arm around
      her.] You are like hot wine with strong spices, and your lips&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      [Tries to kiss her. Julie pulls herself away slowly.]
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. Leave me&mdash;I'm not to be won this way.
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. How then? Not with caresses and beautiful words? Not by thoughts for
      the future, to save humiliation? How then?
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. How? I don't know. I don't know! I shrink from you as I would from
      a rat. But I cannot escape from you.
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. Escape with me.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. Escape? Yes, we must escape.&mdash;But I'm so tired. Give me a
      glass of wine. [Jean fills a glass with wine, Julie looks at her watch.]
      We must talk it over first for we have still a little time left.
    </p>
    <p>
      [She empties the glass and puts it out for more.]
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. Don't drink too much. It will go to your head.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. What harm will that do?
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. What harm? It's foolish to get intoxicated. But what did you want to
      say?
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. We must go away, but we must talk first. That is, I must speak, for
      until now you have done all the talking. You have told me about your life&mdash;now
      I will tell you about mine, then we will know each other through and
      through before we start on our wandering together.
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. One moment, pardon. Think well whether you won't regret having told
      your life's secrets.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. Aren't you my friend?
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. Yes. Sometimes. But don't depend on me.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. You only say that. And for that matter I have no secrets. You see,
      my mother was not of noble birth. She was brought up with ideas of
      equality, woman's freedom and all that. She had very decided opinions
      against matrimony, and when my father courted her she declared that she
      would never be his wife&mdash;but she did so for all that. I came into the
      world against my mother's wishes, I discovered, and was brought up like a
      child of nature by my mother, and taught everything that a boy must know
      as well; I was to be an example of a woman being as good as a man&mdash;I
      was made to go about in boy's clothes and take care of the horses and
      harness and saddle and hunt, and all such things; in fact, all over the
      estate women servants were taught to do men's work, with the result that
      the property came near being ruined&mdash;and so we became the laughing
      stock of the countryside. At last my father must have awakened from his
      bewitched condition, for he revolted, and ran things according to his
      ideas. My mother became ill&mdash;what it was I don't know, but she often
      had cramps and acted queerly&mdash;sometimes hiding in the attic or the
      orchard, and would even be gone all night at times. Then came the big fire
      which of course you have heard about. The house, the stables&mdash;everything
      was burned, under circumstances that pointed strongly to an incendiary,
      for the misfortune happened the day after the quarterly insurance was due
      and the premiums sent in by father were strangely delayed by his messenger
      so that they arrived too late. [She fills a wine glass and drinks.]
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. Don't drink any more.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. Oh, what does it matter? My father was utterly at a loss to know
      where to get money to rebuild with. Then my mother suggested that he try
      to borrow from a man who had been her friend in her youth&mdash;a brick
      manufacturer here in the neighborhood. My father made the loan, but wasn't
      allowed to pay any interest, which surprised him. Then the house was
      rebuilt. [Julie drinks again.] Do you know who burned the house?
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. Her ladyship, your mother?
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. Do you know who the brick manufacturer was?
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. Your mother's lover?
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. Do you know whose money it was?
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. Just a moment, that I don't know.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. It was my mother's.
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. The Count's&mdash;that is to say, unless there was a contract.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. There was no contract. My mother had some money which she had not
      wished to have in my father's keeping and therefore, she had entrusted it
      to her friend's care.
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. Who kept it.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. Quite right&mdash;he held on to it. All this came to my father's
      knowledge. He couldn't proceed against him, wasn't allowed to pay his
      wife's friend, and couldn't prove that it was his wife's money. That was
      my mother's revenge for his taking the reins of the establishment into his
      own hands. At that time he was ready to shoot himself. Gossip had it that
      he had tried and failed. Well, he lived it down&mdash;and my mother paid
      full penalty for her misdeed. Those were five terrible years for me, as
      you can fancy. I sympathized with my father, but I took my mother's part,
      for I didn't know the true circumstances. Through her I learned to
      distrust and hate men, and I swore to her never to be a man's slave.
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. But you became engaged to the Lieutenant Governor.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. Just to make him my slave.
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. But that he didn't care to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. He wanted to be, fast enough, but I grew tired of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. Yes&mdash;I noticed that&mdash;in the stable-yard!
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. What do you mean?
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. I saw how he broke the engagement.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. That's a lie. It was I who broke it. Did he say he broke it&mdash;the
      wretch!
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. I don't believe that he was a wretch. You hate men, Miss Julie.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. Most of them. Sometimes one is weak&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. You hate me?
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. Excessively. I could see you shot&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. Like a mad dog?
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. Exactly!
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. But there is nothing here to shoot with. What shall we do then?
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE [Rousing herself].We must get away from here&mdash;travel.
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. And torture each other to death?
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. No&mdash;to enjoy, a few days, a week&mdash;as long as we can. And
      then to die.
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. Die! How silly. I think it's better to start the hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE [Not heeding him]. By the Lake of Como where the sun is always
      shining, where the laurel is green at Christmas and the oranges glow.
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. The Lake of Como is a rain hole, I never saw any oranges there
      except on fruit stands. But it's a good resort, and there are many villas
      to rent to loving couples. That's a very paying industry. You know why?
      They take leases for half a year at least, but they usually leave in three
      weeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE [Naively]. Why after three weeks?
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. Why? They quarrel of course, but the rent must be paid all the same.
      Then you re-let, and so one after another they come and go, for there is
      plenty of love, although it doesn't last long.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. Then you don't want to die with me?
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. I don't want to die at all, both because I enjoy living and because
      I regard suicide as a crime to Him who has given us life.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. Then you believe in God?
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. Yes. Of course I do, and I go to church every other Sunday&mdash;But
      I'm tired of all this and I'm going to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. Do you think I would allow myself to be satisfied with such an
      ending? Do you know what a man owes to a woman he hits&mdash; &mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN [Takes out a silver coin and throws it on the table]. Allow me, I
      don't want to owe anything to anyone.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE [Pretending not to notice the insult]. Do you know what the law
      demands?
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. I know that the law demands nothing of a woman who seduces a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE [Again not heeding him]. Do you see any way out of it but to travel?&mdash;wed&mdash;and
      separate?
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. And if I protest against this misalliance?
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. Misalliance!
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. Yes, for me. For you see I have a finer ancestry than you, for I
      have no fire-bug in my family.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. How do you know?
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. You can't prove the contrary. We have no family record except that
      which the police keep. But your pedigree I have read in a book on the
      drawing room table. Do you know who the founder of your family was? It was
      a miller whose wife found favor with the king during the Danish War. Such
      ancestry I have not.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. This is my reward for opening my heart to anyone so unworthy, with
      whom I have talked about my family honor.
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. Dishonor&mdash;yes, I said it. I told you not to drink because then
      one talks too freely and one should never talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. Oh, how I repent all this. If at least you loved me!
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. For the last time&mdash;what do you mean? Shall I weep, shall I jump
      over your riding whip, shall I kiss you, lure you to Lake Como for three
      weeks, and then&mdash;what do you want anyway? This is getting tiresome.
      But that's the way it always is when you get mixed up in women's affairs.
      Miss Julie, I see that you are unhappy, I know that you suffer, but I
      can't understand you. Among my kind there is no nonsense of this sort; we
      love as we play when work gives us time. We haven't the whole day and
      night for it like you.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. You must be good to me and speak to me as though I were a human
      being.
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. Be one yourself. You spit on me and expect me to stand it.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. Help me, help me. Only tell me what to do&mdash;show me a way out
      of this!
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. In heaven's name, if I only knew myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. I have been raving, I have been mad, but is there no means of
      deliverance?
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. Stay here at home and say nothing. No one knows.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. Impossible. These people know it, and Kristin.
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. They don't know it and could never suspect such a thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE [Hesitating]. But&mdash;it might happen again.
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. That is true.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. And the consequences?
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN [Frightened]. Consequences&mdash;where were my wits not to have
      thought of that! There is only one thing to do. Get away from here
      immediately. I can't go with you or they will suspect. You must go alone&mdash;away
      from here&mdash;anywhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. Alone? Where? I cannot.
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. You must&mdash;and before the Count returns. If you stay, we know
      how it will be. If one has taken a false step it's likely to happen again
      as the harm has already been done, and one grows more and more daring
      until at last all is discovered. Write the Count afterward and confess all&mdash;except
      that it was I. That he could never guess, and I don't think he'll be so
      anxious to know who it was, anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. I will go if you'll go with me.
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. Are you raving again? Miss Julie running away with her coachman? All
      the papers would be full of it and that the Count could never live
      through.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. I can't go&mdash;I can't stay. Help me, I'm so tired&mdash;so
      weary. Command me, set me in motion&mdash;I can't think any more,&mdash;can't
      act&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. See now, what creatures you aristocrats are! Why do you bristle up
      and stick up your noses as though you were the lords of creation. Very
      well&mdash;I will command you! Go up and dress yourself and see to it that
      you have travelling money and then come down. [She hesitates.] Go
      immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      [She still hesitates. He takes her hand and leads her to door.]
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. Speak gently to me, Jean.
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. A command always sounds harsh. Feel it yourself now.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Exit Julie.]
    </p>
    <p>
      [Jean draws a sigh of relief, seats himself by the table, takes out a
      notebook and pencil and counts aloud now and then until Kristin comes in,
      dressed for church.]
    </p>
    <p>
      KRISTIN. My heavens, how it looks here. What's been going on?
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. Oh, Miss Julie dragged in the people. Have you been sleeping so
      soundly that you didn't hear anything?
    </p>
    <p>
      KRISTIN. I've slept like a log.
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. And already dressed for church!
    </p>
    <p>
      KRISTIN. Ye-es, [Sleepily] didn't you promise to go to early service with
      me?
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. Yes, quite so, and there you have my stock and front. All right.
    </p>
    <p>
      [He seats himself. Kristin putting on his stock.]
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN [Sleepily]. What is the text today?
    </p>
    <p>
      KRISTIN. St. John's Day! It is of course about the beheading of John the
      Baptist.
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. I'm afraid it will be terribly long drawn out&mdash;that. Hey,
      you're choking me. I'm so sleepy, so sleepy.
    </p>
    <p>
      KRISTIN. What have you been doing up all night? You are actually green in
      the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. I have been sitting here talking to Miss Julie.
    </p>
    <p>
      KRISTIN. Oh you don't know your place.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Pause.]
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. Listen, Kristin.
    </p>
    <p>
      KRISTIN. Well?
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. It's queer about her when you think it over.
    </p>
    <p>
      KRISTIN. What is queer?
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. The whole thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Pause. Kristin looks at half empty glasses on table.]
    </p>
    <p>
      KRISTIN. Have you been drinking together, too?
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. Yes!
    </p>
    <p>
      KRISTIN. For shame. Look me in the eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      KRISTIN. Is it possible? Is it possible?
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN [After reflecting]. Yes, it is.
    </p>
    <p>
      KRISTIN. Ugh! That I would never have believed. For shame, for shame!
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. You are not jealous of her?
    </p>
    <p>
      KRISTIN. No, not of her. But if it had been Clara or Sophie&mdash;then I
      would have scratched your eyes out. So that is what has happened&mdash;how
      I can't understand! No, that wasn't very nice!
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. Are you mad at her?
    </p>
    <p>
      KRISTIN. No, but with you. That was bad of you, very bad. Poor girl. Do
      you know what&mdash;I don't want to be here in this house any longer where
      one cannot respect one's betters.
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. Why should one respect them?
    </p>
    <p>
      KRISTIN. Yes, you can say that, you are so smart. But I don't want to
      serve people who behave so. It reflects on oneself, I think.
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. Yes, but it's a comfort that they're not a bit better than we.
    </p>
    <p>
      KRISTIN. No, I don't think so, for if they are not better there's no use
      in our trying to better ourselves in this world. And to think of the
      Count! Think of him who has had so much sorrow all his days? No, I don't
      want to stay in this house any longer! And to think of it being with such
      as you! If it had been the Lieutenant&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. What's that?
    </p>
    <p>
      KRISTIN. Yes! He was good enough, to be sure, but there's a difference
      between people just the same. No, this I can never forget. Miss Julie who
      was always so proud and indifferent to men! One never would believe that
      she would give herself&mdash;and to one like you! She who was ready to
      have Diana shot because she would run after the gatekeeper's mongrels.
      Yes, I say it&mdash;and here I won't stay any longer and on the
      twenty-fourth of October I go my way.
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. And then?
    </p>
    <p>
      KRISTIN. Well, as we've come to talk about it, it's high time you looked
      around for something else, since we're going to get married.
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. Well, what'll I look for? A married man couldn't get a place like
      this.
    </p>
    <p>
      KRISTIN. No, of course not. But you could take a gatekeeper's job or look
      for a watchman's place in some factory. The government's plums are few,
      but they are sure. And then the wife and children get a pension&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN [With a grimace]. That's all very fine&mdash;all that, but it's not
      exactly in my line to think about dying for my wife and children just now.
      I must confess that I have slightly different aspirations.
    </p>
    <p>
      KRISTIN. Aspirations? Aspirations&mdash;anyway you have obligations. Think
      of those, you.
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. Don't irritate me with talk about my obligations. I know my own
      business. [He listens.] We'll have plenty of time for all this some other
      day. Go and get ready and we'll be off to church.
    </p>
    <p>
      KRISTIN [Listening]. Who's that walking upstairs?
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. I don't know&mdash;unless it's Clara.
    </p>
    <p>
      KRISTIN [Starting to go]. It could never be the Count who has come home
      without anyone hearing him?
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN [Frightened]. The Count! I can't believe that. He would have rung the
      bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      KRISTIN. God help us! Never have I been mixed up in anything like this!
    </p>
    <p>
      [Exit Kristin. The sun has risen and lights up the scene. Presently the
      sunshine comes in through windows at an angle. Jean goes to door and
      motions. Enter Julie, dressed for travelling, carrying a small bird cage
      covered with a cloth, which she places on a chair.]
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. I am ready!
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. Hush, Kristin is stirring!
    </p>
    <p>
      [Julie frightened and nervous throughout following scene.]
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. Does she suspect anything?
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. She knows nothing. But, good heavens, how you look!
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. Why?
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. You are pale as a ghost.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE [Sighs]. Am I? Oh, the sun is rising, the sun!
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. And now the troll's spell is broken.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. The trolls have indeed been at work this night. But, Jean, listen&mdash;come
      with me, I have money enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. Plenty?
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. Enough to start with. Go with me for I can't go alone&mdash;today,
      midsummer day. Think of the stuffy train, packed in with the crowds of
      people staring at one; the long stops at the stations when one would be
      speeding away. No, I cannot, I cannot! And then the memories, childhood's
      memories of midsummer day&mdash;the church decorated with birch branches
      and syringa blossoms; the festive dinner table with relations and friends,
      afternoon in the park, music, dancing, flowers and games&mdash;oh, one may
      fly, fly, but anguish and remorse follow in the pack wagon.
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. I'll go with you&mdash;if we leave instantly&mdash;before it's too
      late.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. Go and dress then. [She takes up bird cage.]
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. But no baggage! That would betray us.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. Nothing but what we can take in the coupé.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Jean has picked up his hat.]
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. What have you there?
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. It's only my canary. I cannot, will not, leave it behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. So we are to lug a bird cage with us. Are you crazy? Let go of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. It is all I take from home. The only living creature that cares for
      me. Don't be hard&mdash;let me take it with me.
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. Let go the cage and don't talk so loud. Kristin will hear us.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. No, I will not leave it to strange hands. I would rather see it
      dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. Give me the creature. I'll fix it.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. Yes, but don't hurt it. Don't&mdash;no, I cannot.
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. Let go. I can.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE [Takes the canary from cage]. Oh, my little siren. Must your
      mistress part with you?
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. Be so good as not to make a scene. Your welfare, your life, is at
      stake. So&mdash;quickly. [Snatches bird from her and goes to chopping
      block and takes up meat chopper]. You should have learned how to chop off
      a chicken's head instead of shooting with a revolver. [He chops off the
      bird's head]. Then you wouldn't swoon at a drop of blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE [Shrieks]. Kill me, too. Kill me! You who can butcher an innocent
      bird without a tremble. Oh, how I shrink from you. I curse the moment I
      first saw you. I curse the moment I was conceived in my mother's womb.
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. Come now! What good is your cursing, let's be off.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE [Looks toward chopping block as though obsessed by thought of the
      slain bird]. No, I cannot. I must see&mdash; &mdash;hush, a carriage is
      passing. Don't you think I can stand the sight of blood? You think I am
      weak. Oh, I should like to see your blood flowing&mdash;to see your brain
      on the chopping block, all your sex swimming in a sea of blood. I believe
      I could drink out of your skull, bathe my feet in your breast and eat your
      heart cooked whole. You think I am weak; you believe that I love you
      because my life has mingled with yours; you think that I would carry your
      offspring under my heart, and nourish it with my blood&mdash;give birth to
      your child and take your name! Hear, you, what are you called, what is
      your family name? But I'm sure you have none. I should be "Mrs.
      Gate-Keeper," perhaps, or "Madame Dumpheap." You dog with my collar on,
      you lackey with my father's hallmark on your buttons. I play rival to my
      cook&mdash;oh&mdash;oh&mdash;oh! You believe that I am cowardly and want
      to run away. No, now I shall stay. The thunder may roll. My father will
      return&mdash;and find his desk broken into&mdash;his money gone! Then he
      will ring&mdash;that bell. A scuffle with his servant&mdash;then sends for
      the police&mdash;and then I tell all&mdash;everything! Oh, it will be
      beautiful to have it all over with&mdash;if only that were the end! And my
      father&mdash;he'll have a shock and die, and then that will be the end.
      Then they will place his swords across the coffin&mdash;and the Count's
      line is extinct. The serf's line will continue in an orphanage, win honors
      in the gutter and end in prison.
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. Now it is the king's blood talking. Splendid, Miss Julie! Only keep
      the miller in his sack.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Enter Kristin with prayer-book in hand.]
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE [Hastening to Kristin and falls in her arms as though seeking
      protection]. Help me, Kristin, help me against this man.
    </p>
    <p>
      KRISTIN [Cold and unmoved]. What kind of performance is this for a holy
      day morning? What does this mean&mdash;this noise and fuss?
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. Kristin, you are a woman,&mdash;and my friend. Beware of this
      wretch.
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN [A little embarrassed and surprised]. While the ladies are arguing
      I'll go and shave myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Jean goes, R.]
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. You must understand me&mdash;you must listen to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      KRISTIN. No&mdash;I can't understand all this bosh. Where may you be going
      in your traveling dress?&mdash;and he had his hat on! Hey?
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. Listen to me, Kristin, listen to me and I'll tell you everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      KRISTIN. I don't want to know anything&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. You must listen to me&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      KRISTIN. What about? Is it that foolishness with Jean? That doesn't
      concern me at all. That I won't be mixed up with, but if you're trying to
      lure him to run away with you then we must put a stop to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE [Nervously]. Try to be calm now Kristin, and listen to me. I can't
      stay here and Jean can't stay here. That being true, we must leave&mdash;
      &mdash;Kristin.
    </p>
    <p>
      KRISTIN. Hm, hm!
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE [Brightening up]. But I have an idea&mdash;what if we three should
      go&mdash;away&mdash;to foreign parts. To Switzerland and set up a hotel
      together&mdash;I have money you see&mdash;and Jean and I would back the
      whole thing, you could run the kitchen. Won't that be fine? Say yes, now&mdash;and
      come with us&mdash;there everything would be arranged&mdash;say yes!
      [Throws her arms around Kristin and coaxes her].
    </p>
    <p>
      KRISTIN [Cold and reflecting]. Hm&mdash;hm!
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE [Presto tempo]. You have never been out and traveled, Kristin. You
      shall look about you in the world. You can't believe how pleasant
      traveling on a train is&mdash;new faces continually, new countries&mdash;and
      we'll go to Hamburg&mdash;and passing through we'll see the zoological
      gardens&mdash;that you will like&mdash;then we'll go to the theatre and
      hear the opera&mdash;and when we reach Munich there will be the museum&mdash;there
      are Rubins and Raphaels and all the big painters that you know&mdash;you
      have heard of Munich&mdash;where King Ludwig lived&mdash;the King, you
      know, who went mad. Then we'll see his palace&mdash;a palace like those in
      the Sagas&mdash;and from there it isn't far to Switzerland&mdash;and the
      Alps, the Alps mind you with snow in mid-summer. And there oranges grow
      and laurel&mdash;green all the year round if&mdash;[Jean is seen in the
      doorway R. stropping his razor on the strop which he holds between his
      teeth and left hand. He listens and nods his head favorably now and then.
      Julie continues, tempo prestissimo] And there we'll take a hotel and I'll
      sit taking the cash while Jean greets the guests&mdash;goes out and
      markets&mdash;writes letters&mdash;that will be life, you may believe&mdash;then
      the train whistles&mdash;then the omnibus comes&mdash;then a bell rings
      upstairs, then in the restaurant&mdash;and then I make out the bills&mdash;and
      I can salt them&mdash;you can't think how people tremble when they receive
      their bill&mdash;and you&mdash;you can sit like a lady&mdash;of course you
      won't have to stand over the stove&mdash;you can dress finely and neatly
      when you show yourself to the people&mdash;and you with your appearance&mdash;Oh,
      I'm not flattering, you can catch a husband some fine day&mdash;a rich
      Englishman perhaps&mdash;they are so easy to&mdash;[Slowing up] to catch&mdash;
      &mdash;Then we'll be rich&mdash;and then we'll build a villa by Lake Como&mdash;to
      be sure it rains sometimes&mdash;but [becoming languid] the sun must shine
      too sometimes&mdash; &mdash; &mdash;although it seems dark&mdash; &mdash;
      &mdash;and if not&mdash;we can at least travel homeward&mdash;and come
      back&mdash;here&mdash;or some other place.
    </p>
    <p>
      KRISTIN. Listen now. Does Miss Julie believe in all this?
    </p>
    <p>
      [Julie going to pieces.]
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. Do I believe in it?
    </p>
    <p>
      KRISTIN. Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE [Tired]. I don't know. I don't believe in anything any more. [Sinks
      down on bench, and takes head in her hand on table.] In nothing&mdash;nothing!
    </p>
    <p>
      KRISTIN [Turns to R. and looks toward Jean]. So&mdash;you intended to run
      away?
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN [Rather shamefaced comes forward and puts razor on table]. Run away?
      That's putting it rather strong. You heard Miss Julie's project, I think
      it might be carried out.
    </p>
    <p>
      KRISTIN. Now listen to that! Was it meant that I should be her cook&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN [Sharply]. Be so good as to use proper language when you speak of
      your mistress.
    </p>
    <p>
      KRISTIN. Mistress?
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      KRISTIN. No&mdash;hear! Listen to him!
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. Yes, you listen&mdash;you need to, and talk less. Miss Julie is your
      mistress and for the same reason that you do not respect her now you
      should not respect yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
      KRISTIN. I have always had so much respect for myself&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. That you never had any left for others!
    </p>
    <p>
      KRISTIN. I have never lowered my position. Let any one say, if they can,
      that the Count's cook has had anything to do with the riding master or the
      swineherd. Let them come and say it!
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. Yes, you happened to get a fine fellow. That was your good luck.
    </p>
    <p>
      KRISTIN. Yes, a fine fellow&mdash;who sells the Count's oats from his
      stable.
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. Is it for you to say anything&mdash;you who get a commission on all
      the groceries and a bribe from the butcher?
    </p>
    <p>
      KRISTIN. What's that?
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. And you can't have respect for your master and mistress any longer&mdash;you,
      you!
    </p>
    <p>
      KRISTIN [Glad to change the subject]. Are you coming to church with me?
      You need a good sermon for your actions.
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. No, I'm not going to church today. You can go alone&mdash;and
      confess your doings.
    </p>
    <p>
      KRISTIN. Yes, that I shall do, and I shall return with so much forgiveness
      that there will be enough for you too. The Savior suffered and died on the
      cross for all our sins, and when we go to Him in faith and a repentant
      spirit he takes our sins on Himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. Do you believe that, Kristin?
    </p>
    <p>
      KRISTIN. That is my life's belief, as true as I stand here. And that was
      my childhood's belief that I have kept since my youth, Miss Julie. And
      where sin overflows, there mercy overflows also.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. Oh, if I only had your faith. Oh, if&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      KRISTIN. Yes, but you see that is not given without God's particular
      grace, and that is not allotted to all, that!
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. Who are the chosen?
    </p>
    <p>
      KRISTIN. That is the great secret of the Kingdom of Grace, and the Lord
      has no respect for persons. But there the last shall be first.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. But then has he respect for the last&mdash;the lowliest person?
    </p>
    <p>
      KRISTIN [Continuing]. It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of
      a needle than for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of Heaven. That's the
      way it is, Miss Julie. However&mdash;now I am going&mdash;alone. And on my
      way I shall stop in and tell the stable boy not to let any horses go out
      in case any one wants to get away before the Count comes home. Good bye.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Exit Kristin.]
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. Such a devil. And all this on account of your confounded canary!
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE [Tired]. Oh, don't speak of the canary&mdash;do you see any way out&mdash;any
      end to this?
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN [Thinking]. No.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. What would you do in my place?
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. In your place&mdash;wait. As a noble lady, as a woman&mdash;fallen&mdash;I
      don't know. Yes, now I know.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE [She takes up razor from table and makes gestures saying] This?
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. Yes. But <i>I</i> should not do it, mark you, for there is a
      difference between us.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. Because you are a man and I am a woman? What other difference is
      there?
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. That very difference&mdash;of man and woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE [Razor in hand]. I want to do it&mdash;but I can't. My father
      couldn't either that time when he should have done it.
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. No, he was right, not to do it&mdash;he had to avenge himself first.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. And now my mother revenges herself again through me.
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. Haven't you loved your father, Miss Julie?
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. Yes, deeply. But I have probably hated him too, I must have&mdash;without
      being aware of it. And it is due to my father's training that I have
      learned to scorn my own sex. Between them both they have made me half man,
      half woman. Whose is the fault for what has happened&mdash;my father's? My
      mother's? My own? I haven't anything of my own. I haven't a thought which
      was not my father's&mdash;not a passion that wasn't my mother's. And last
      of all from my betrothed the idea that all people are equal. For that I
      now call him a wretch. How can it be my own fault then? Throw the burden
      on Jesus as Kristin did? No, I am too proud, too intelligent, thanks to my
      father's teaching.&mdash; &mdash;And that a rich man cannot enter the
      Kingdom of Heaven&mdash;that is a lie, and Kristin, who has money in the
      savings bank&mdash;she surely cannot enter there. Whose is the fault? What
      does it concern us whose fault it is? It is I who must bear the burden and
      the consequences.
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. Yes, but&mdash; &mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      [Two sharp rings on bell are heard. Julie starts to her feet. Jean changes
      his coat.]
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. The Count&mdash;has returned. Think if Kristin has&mdash; [Goes up
      to speaking tube and listens.]
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. Now he has seen the desk!
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN [Speaking in the tube]. It is Jean, Excellency. [Listens]. Yes,
      Excellency. [Listens].Yes, Excellency,&mdash;right away&mdash;immediately,
      Excellency. Yes&mdash;in half an hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE [In great agitation]. What did he say? In Heaven's name, what did he
      say?
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. He wants his boots and coffee in a half hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. In half an hour then. Oh, I'm so tired&mdash;I'm incapable of
      feeling, not able to be sorry, not able to go, not able to stay, not able
      to live&mdash;not able to die. Help me now. Command me&mdash;I will obey
      like a dog. Do me this last service&mdash;save my honor. Save his name.
      You know what I have the will to do&mdash;but cannot do. You will it and
      command me to execute your will.
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. I don't know why&mdash;but now I can't either.&mdash;I don't
      understand myself. It is absolutely as though this coat does it&mdash;but
      I can't command you now. And since the Count spoke to me&mdash; &mdash;I
      can't account for it&mdash;but oh, it is that damned servant in my back&mdash;I
      believe if the Count came in here now and told me to cut my throat I would
      do it on the spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. Make believe you are he&mdash;and I you. You could act so well a
      little while ago when you knelt at my feet. Then you were a nobleman&mdash;or
      haven't you ever been at the theatre and seen the hypnotist&mdash;[Jean
      nods] He says to his subject "Take the broom," and he takes it; he says,
      "Sweep," and he sweeps.
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. Then the subject must be asleep!
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE [Ecstatically]. I sleep already. The whole room is like smoke before
      me&mdash;and you are like a tall black stove, like a man clad in black
      clothes with a high hat; and your eyes gleam like the hot coals when the
      fire is dying; and your face a white spot like fallen ashes. [The sunshine
      is coming in through the windows and falls on Jean. Julie rubs her hands
      as though warming them before a fire]. It is so warm and good&mdash;and so
      bright and quiet!
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN [Takes razor and puts it in her hand]. There is the broom, go now
      while it's bright&mdash;out to the hay loft&mdash;and&mdash;[He whispers
      in her ear.]
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE [Rousing herself]. Thanks. And now I go to rest. But tell me this&mdash;the
      foremost may receive the gift of Grace? Say it, even if you don't believe
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. The foremost? No, I can't say that. But wait, Miss Julie&mdash;you
      are no longer among the foremost since you are of the lowliest.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. That's true, I am the lowliest&mdash;the lowliest of the lowly. Oh,
      now I can't go. Tell me once more that I must go.
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. No, now I cannot either&mdash;I cannot.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIE. And the first shall be last&mdash; &mdash; &mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN. Don't think. You take my strength from me, too, so that I become
      cowardly.&mdash;What&mdash; &mdash;I thought I heard the bell!&mdash;
      &mdash; No! To be afraid of the sound of a bell! But it's not the bell&mdash;it's
      someone behind the bell, the hand that sets the bell in motion&mdash;and
      something else that sets the hand in motion. But stop your ears, stop your
      ears. Then he will only ring louder and keep on ringing until it's
      answered&mdash;and then it is too late! Then come the police and then&mdash;[Two
      loud rings on bell are heard, Jean falls in a heap for a moment, but
      straightens up immediately.] It is horrible! But there is no other way.
      Go!
    </p>
    <p>
      [Countess Julie goes out resolutely.]

     THORFINN, Erl of Iceland
     VALGERD, his wife

     ORM, a minstrel, foster brother to Thorfinn
     A THRALL
     A MESSENGER
</pre>
    <p>
      Action takes place in Iceland.
    </p>
    <p>
      [SCENE&mdash;A hut, door at back, window-holes, right and, left, closed by
      big heavy wooden shutters. Wooden benches against walls, the high bench, a
      sort of rude throne, at left. The uprights of this high beach are carved
      with images of the gods Odin and Thor. From the wall beams hang swords,
      battle axes and shields. Near the high bench stands a harp. Gunlöd stands
      at an open window-hole peering out; through the opening one gets a glimpse
      of the sea lighted by the aurora borealis. Valgerd sits by the fire, which
      is in the middle of the room, spinning.]
    </p>
    <p>
      VALGERD. Close the window-hole.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Gunlöd is silent.]
    </p>
    <p>
      VALGERD. Gunlöd!
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNLÖD. Did you speak, mother?
    </p>
    <p>
      VALGERD. What are you doing?
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNLÖD. I am watching the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      VALGERD. When will you learn to forget?
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNLÖD. Take everything away from me but memories!
    </p>
    <p>
      VALGERD. Look forward&mdash;not back.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNLÖD. Who reproaches the strong viking who looks back when he is
      quitting his native strand?
    </p>
    <p>
      VALGERD. You have had three winters to make your farewell.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNLÖD. You speak truly&mdash;three winters! For here never came a summer!
    </p>
    <p>
      VALGERD. When the floating ice melts, then shall spring be here.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNLÖD. The Northern Lights melt no ice.
    </p>
    <p>
      VALGERD. Nor your tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNLÖD. You never saw me weep.
    </p>
    <p>
      VALGERD. But I have heard you. As long as you do that, you are a child.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNLÖD. I am not a child.
    </p>
    <p>
      VALGERD. If you would be a woman, suffer in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNLÖD. I'll cast sorrow from me, mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      VALGERD. No, no&mdash;bury it, as your deepest treasure. The seed must not
      lie on top of the earth if it would sprout and ripen. You have a deep
      sorrow. It should bear great gladness&mdash;and great peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNLÖD [After a pause]. I shall forget.
    </p>
    <p>
      VALGERD. Everything?
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNLÖD. I shall try.
    </p>
    <p>
      VALGERD. Can you forget your father's hardness?
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNLÖD. That I have forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      VALGERD. Can you forget that there was a time when your fore-fathers'
      dwelling stood on Brövikens' strand? Where the south wind sang in the oak
      wood when the ice-bound seas ran free&mdash;where the hemlocks gave forth
      their fragrance and the finches twittered among the linden trees&mdash;and
      Balder, the God of spring and joy, lulled you to sleep on the green
      meadows? Can you forget all this, while you listen to the sea gulls'
      plaints on these bare rocks and cliffs, and the cold storms out of the
      north howl through the stunted birches?
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNLÖD. Yes!
    </p>
    <p>
      VALGERD. Can you forget the friend of your childhood from whom your father
      tore you to save you from the white Christ?
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNLÖD [in desperation]. Yes, yes!
    </p>
    <p>
      VALGERD. You are weeping.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNLÖD [Disturbed]. Some one is walking out there. Perhaps father is
      coming home.
    </p>
    <p>
      VALGERD. Will you bear in mind every day without tears that we now dwell
      in the land of ice&mdash;fugitives from the kingdom of Svea and hated here
      by the Christ-men? But we have suffered no loss of greatness, although we
      have not been baptized and kissed the bishop's hand. Have you ever spoken
      to any of the Christians since we have been here?
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNLÖD [After a pause]. No. Tell me, mother, is it true that father is to
      be Erl here in Iceland, too?
    </p>
    <p>
      VALGERD. Don't let that trouble you, child.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNLÖD. Then I'm afraid he will fare badly with the Christians.
    </p>
    <p>
      VALGERD. You fear that?
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNLÖD. Some one is out there.
    </p>
    <p>
      VALGERD [Anxiously]. Did you see the ship lying in the inlet this morning?
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNLÖD. With heart-felt gladness!
    </p>
    <p>
      VALGERD. Bore it the figure-head of Thorfinn?
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNLÖD. That I could not make out.
    </p>
    <p>
      VALGERD. Have a care, girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNLÖD. Is it tonight that I may go out?
    </p>
    <p>
      VALGERD. Tomorrow&mdash;that you know well.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNLÖD Mother!
    </p>
    <p>
      VALGERD [Going]. Mind the fire. [Valgerd goes.]
    </p>
    <p>
      [Gunlöd looks after her mother, then cautiously takes from her breast a
      crucifix, puts it on the high bench and falls on her knees.]
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNLÖD. Christ, Christ, forgive me the lie I told. [Springs up noticing
      the images of the gods on the high bench.] No, I cannot pray before these
      wicked images. [She looks for another place.] Holy St. Olof, holy&mdash;oh,
      I can't remember how the bishop named her! God! God! Cast me not into
      purgatory for this sin! I will repeat the whole long prayer of the monks&mdash;credo,
      credo&mdash;in patrem&mdash;oh, I have forgotten that too. I shall give
      five tall candles for the altar of the mother of God the next time I go to
      the chapel&mdash;Credo, in patrem omnipotentem&mdash;[Kissing the crucifix
      eagerly.]
    </p>
    <p>
      [A song is heard outside the hut accompanied by a lyre.]
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    A crusader went out to the Holy Land,
    O, Christ, take the maiden's soul in hand,
    And to your kingdom bring her!
    I'll return, mayhap, when the spruce trees bloom.

    Summers three he wanders far from thee,
    Where nightingales sing their delight,
    And masses he holds both day and night,
    At the holy sepulchre's chapel.
    I'll return, mayhap, when the spruce trees bloom.

    When the palm trees bud on Jordan's strand,
    Then makes he a prayer to God,
    That he may return to his native land,
    And press to his heart his love.
    I'll return, my love, when the spruce trees bloom.
</pre>
    <p>
      GUNLÖD [At beginning of song springs up and then listens with more and
      more agitation and eagerness. When the song is over she goes toward door
      to bolt it, but so slowly that Gunnar is able to enter before she slips
      the bolt. Gunnar is clad in the costume of a crusader with a lyre swung
      across his shoulder.]
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNNAR. Gunlöd! [They embrace. Gunlöd pulls away and goes toward door.]
      You are afraid of me? What is it, Gunlöd?
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNLÖD. You never took me in your arms before!
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNNAR. We were children then!
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNLÖD You are right&mdash;we were children then. What means that silver
      falcon on your shield? I saw it on your ship's bow this morning, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNNAR. You saw my ship&mdash;you knew my song, and you would have barred
      the door against me! What am I to understand, Gunlöd?
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNLÖD. Oh, ask me nothing! I am so unquiet of spirit but sit and let me
      talk to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNNAR [Sits]. You are silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNLÖD. You are silent, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNNAR [Pulls her to his side]. Gunlöd, Gunlöd&mdash;has the snow fallen
      so heavily that memories have been chilled even the mountains here burst
      forth with fire&mdash;and you are cold as a snow wind&mdash;but speak&mdash;speak!
      Why are you here in Iceland&mdash;and what has happened?
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNLÖD. Terrible things&mdash;and more may follow if you stay here longer.&mdash;[Springs
      up]. Go, before my father comes.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNNAR. Do you think I would leave you now&mdash;I, who have sought you
      for long years? When I could not find you in the home land I went to the
      wars against the Saracens to seek you the other side of the grave. But my
      time had not yet come; when the fourth spring came, I heard through
      wandering merchants that you were to be found here. Now I have found you&mdash;and
      you wish me to leave you in this heathen darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNLÖD. I am not alone!
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNNAR. Your father does not love you&mdash;your mother does not
      understand you, and they are both heathen.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNLÖD. I have friends among the Christians.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNNAR. Then you have become a Christian, Gunlöd!&mdash;the holy virgin
      has heard my prayer.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNLÖD. Yes, yes! Oh, let me kiss the cross you bear on your shoulder&mdash;that
      you got at the holy sepulchre!
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNNAR. Now I give you a brother Christian's kiss&mdash;the first, Gunlöd,
      you have from me.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNLÖD. You must never kiss me again.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNNAR. But tell me, how did you become a Christian?
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNLÖD. First I believed in my father&mdash;he was so strong; then I
      believed in my mother&mdash;she was so good; last I believed in you&mdash;you
      were so strong and good&mdash;and so beautiful; and when you went away&mdash;I
      stood alone&mdash;myself I could never believe in&mdash;I was so weak;
      then I thought of your God, whom you so often begged me to love&mdash;and
      I prayed to Him.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNNAR. And the old gods&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNLÖD. I have never been able to believe in them&mdash;although my father
      commanded me to do so&mdash;they are wicked.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNNAR. Who has taught you to pray? Who gave you the crucifix?
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNLÖD. The bishop.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNNAR. And that no one knows?
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNLÖD. No&mdash;I have had to lie to my mother and that troubles me.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNNAR. And your father hid you here so that the Christians should not get
      you?
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNLÖD. Yes&mdash;and now he is expected home from Norway with followers
      as he is to be Erl of the island.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNNAR. God forbid!
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNLÖD. Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;but you must not delay. He is expected home
      tonight.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNNAR. Good&mdash;there beyond Hjärleif's headland lies my ship.&mdash;Out
      to sea! There is a land wind, and before the first cock's crow we shall be
      beyond pursuit.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNLÖD. Yes! Yes!
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNNAR. Soon we should be at Ostergötland&mdash;where the summer is still
      green&mdash;and there you shall live in my castle which I have built where
      your father's house stood.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNLÖD. Does not that still stand?
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNNAR. No&mdash;it was burned.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNLÖD. By the Christians?
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNNAR. You are so passionate, Gunlöd!
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNLÖD. I suffer to say I would rather be a heathen.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNNAR. What are you saying, girl!
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNLÖD. [After a pause]. Forgive me, forgive me&mdash;I am in such a wild
      mood&mdash;and when I see the Christians, who should be examples, commit
      such deeds&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNNAR. Crush out that thought, Gunlöd&mdash;it is ungodly. Do you see
      this wreath?
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNLÖD. Where did you gather it?
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNNAR. You recognize the flowers, Gunlöd?
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNLÖD. They grew in my father's garden&mdash;may I keep them?
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNNAR. Gladly&mdash;but, why do you care to have them when we are going
      to journey there ourselves?
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNLÖD. I shall look at them the long winter through&mdash;the hemlock
      shall remind me of the green woods and the anemones of the blue sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNNAR. And when they are withered&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNLÖD. Of that I do not think.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNNAR. Then go with me from this drear land&mdash;far away, and there
      where our childhood was spent we will live as free as the birds among the
      flowers and sunshine. There you shall not go in stealth to the temple of
      the Lord when the bells tell you of the Sabbath. Oh, you shall see the new
      chapel with its vaulted roof and high pillared aisles. And hear the
      acolytes singing when the bishop lights the incense on the high altar.
      There shall you solemnize the God service with those of Christ and you
      shall feel you heart cleansed of sin.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNLÖD. Shall I fly&mdash;leave my mother?
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNNAR. She will forgive you some time.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNLÖD. But my father would call me cowardly and that I would never allow.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNNAR. That you must endure for the sake of your belief.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNLÖD. Thorfinn's daughter was never cowardly.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNNAR. Your father does not love you, and he will hate you when he knows
      of your conversion.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNLÖD. That he may do&mdash;but he shall never despise me.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNNAR. You surrender your love, Gunlöd.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNLÖD. Love!&mdash;I remember&mdash;there was a maiden&mdash;she had a
      friend who went away&mdash;after, she was never again glad&mdash;she only
      sat sewing silk and gold&mdash;what she was making no one knew&mdash;and
      when they asked her she would only weep. And when they asked her why she
      wept, she never answered&mdash;only wept. She grew pale of cheek and her
      mother made ready her shroud.&mdash;Then there came an old woman and she
      said it was love. Gunnar,&mdash;I never wept when you went away as father
      says it is weak to shed tears; I never sewed silk and gold for that my
      mother has never taught me to do&mdash;then had I not love?
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNNAR. You have often thought of me during these years?
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNLÖD. I have dreamed so often of you, and this morning when I stood by
      the window where I linger so willingly and, gazing over the sea, I saw
      your ship come up out of the east, I became unquiet although I did not
      know it was your ship.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNNAR. Why do you gaze so willingly over the sea?
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNLÖD. You ask many questions!
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNNAR. Why did you want to close the door against me?
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNLÖD. [Silent].
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNNAR. Why didn't you close it?
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNLÖD. [Silent].
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNNAR. Why are you silent?
    </p>
    <p>
      [Gunlöd bursts into tears.]
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNNAR. You weep, Gunlöd, and you know why? I know,&mdash;you love! [Takes
      her in his arms and kisses her.]
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNLÖD. [Tearing herself away]. You must not kiss me! Go!
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNNAR. Yes&mdash;and you shall go with me.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNLÖD. I do not care to be commanded by you&mdash;and I shall not obey.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNNAR. The volcano gives forth fire&mdash;and burns itself out!
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNLÖD. You have destroyed my peace&mdash;forever! Go and let me forget
      you.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNNAR. Do you know what the silver falcon with the ribbon stands for? It
      is the symbol of the wild girl I shall tame.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNLÖD. [With force]. You! Go before I hate you!&mdash;No one yet has bent
      my will!
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNNAR. The wild fire of the viking's blood still burns in your veins, but
      it shall be quenched. A day and a night shall I wait for you. And you will
      come&mdash;mild as a dove seeking shelter, although you now would fly
      above the clouds like a wild falcon. But I still hold the ribbon in my
      hand&mdash;that is your love, which you cannot tear away. When twilight
      falls again you will come. Till then, farewell. [Goes to the door and
      stops.]
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNLÖD. [Silent.]
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNNAR. [Going.] Farewell.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNLÖD. We shall see, proud knight, who comes first. When this garland
      shall bloom again, then shall I come. [Throws garland in fire. She watches
      it burn in a thoughtful mood. When it is quite burnt she breaks into tears
      again and falls on her knees.] God! God! Soften my proud spirit! Oh, that
      he should leave me! [Hastens to door. At same moment Valgerd enters,
      passes Gunlöd, and goes to fire.]
    </p>
    <p>
      VALGERD. Why did you not tend the fire?
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNLÖD. [Silent.]
    </p>
    <p>
      VALGERD [Putting her hand against Gunlöd's heart]. You have a secret!
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNLÖD. Yes, mother, yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      VALGERD. Hide it well.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNLÖD. Oh, I must speak&mdash;I can't bear it any longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      VALGERD. When saw you a mother who did not know a daughter's secrets?
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNLÖD. Who told you mine?
    </p>
    <p>
      VALGERD [Harshly]. Dry your tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      [A pause.]
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNLÖD. Oh, let me go out&mdash;on the mountains&mdash;on the strand. It
      is so stifling here.
    </p>
    <p>
      VALGERD. Go up to the loft&mdash;and you can be alone. [Enter a thrall.]
      What would you?
    </p>
    <p>
      THRALL. The Erl's trumpets are heard beyond the rocks and the storm is
      growing.
    </p>
    <p>
      VALGERD. Has darkness fallen?
    </p>
    <p>
      THRALL. Yes, and a terrible darkness it is.
    </p>
    <p>
      [A pause.]
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNLÖD. Send out a boat&mdash;two&mdash;as many as can be found.
    </p>
    <p>
      THRALL. All the boats are out for the hunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNLÖD. Light beacon fires.
    </p>
    <p>
      THRALL. All the fuel is so rain-soaked that we haven't had so much as a
      twig on the hearth all the evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      VALGERD. Away!
    </p>
    <p>
      THRALL. How will it go with the Erl?
    </p>
    <p>
      VALGERD. Does that concern you?
    </p>
    <p>
      [Thrall goes.]
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNLÖD. You have not forgotten your wrong!
    </p>
    <p>
      VALGERD. Nor my revenge! One should not lay hands on the daughter of an
      Erl!
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNLÖD. So be it. Now your moment has come&mdash;take your revenge&mdash;I'll
      show you how&mdash;like this. [Takes a lighted torch.] Put this torch in
      the window-hole on the right and you wreck him. Put it in the left and you
      save him&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      VALGERD [Interrupts]. Give me the torch and leave me.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNLÖD. There is a sacrifice which can pacify your god's. Sacrifice your
      revenge.
    </p>
    <p>
      VALGERD. [Takes torch, hesitates, and goes quickly to left window-hole and
      places it there. Trumpets are heard]. You struck me, Thorfinn&mdash;I
      swore revenge&mdash;I shall humble you with a kind deed.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNLÖD [Unseen by Valgerd has entered and falls on her mother's neck].
      Thanks, mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      VALGERD [Disconcerted]. Haven't you gone&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNLÖD. Now I shall go. [Gunlöd goes.]
    </p>
    <p>
      VALGERD [Alone by the window-hole]. You shout for help, you mighty man,
      who always helped yourself. [Trumpets are heard.] Where is now your might&mdash;where
      is your kingdom&mdash;[A gust of wind blows out the lighted torch.
      Valgerd, terribly frightened, takes torch and lights it.] Oh, he will
      perish! What shall I do? Pray? To whom? Odin? Njard? Ogir? I have called
      to them for four times ten years, but never have they answered. I have
      sacrificed, but never have they helped. Thou, God, however you may be
      called&mdash;Thou mighty one, who bids the sun to rise and set, thou
      tremendous one who rules over the winds and water&mdash;to you will I
      pray, to you will I sacrifice my revenge if you will save him.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Orm enters unnoticed.]
    </p>
    <p>
      ORM. Good evening to you, Valgerd. Put on your cloak&mdash;the wind is
      sharp.
    </p>
    <p>
      VALGERD [Disconcerted, takes down torch and closes window-hole.] Welcome,
      Orm.
    </p>
    <p>
      ORM. Thanks.
    </p>
    <p>
      VALGERD. How is it with you, Orm?
    </p>
    <p>
      ORM. Tolerable enough&mdash;-when one gets near the big logs.
    </p>
    <p>
      VALGERD [Irritated]. How went the journey I mean?
    </p>
    <p>
      ORM. That is a long saga.
    </p>
    <p>
      VALGERD. Make it short.
    </p>
    <p>
      ORM. Well, as you know, we fared to Norway, seeking men and timber.
    </p>
    <p>
      VALGERD. Orm!
    </p>
    <p>
      ORM. Valgerd!
    </p>
    <p>
      VALGERD. You have not spoken a word of the Erl.
    </p>
    <p>
      ORM. Have you asked a word about your mate?
    </p>
    <p>
      VALGERD. Where is he? Lives he?
    </p>
    <p>
      ORM. I know not.
    </p>
    <p>
      VALGERD. You know not!&mdash;you, his foster brother? Where did you part
      from him?
    </p>
    <p>
      ORM. Far out in the gulf. It was merry out there you may believe. You
      should have seen him swimming with my lyre in his hand. The sea-weed was
      so tangled in his beard and hair that one was tempted to believe that it
      was Neptune himself. Just then came a wave as big as a house&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      VALGERD. And then?
    </p>
    <p>
      ORM. And then&mdash;I saw my lyre no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      VALGERD. Orm! You jest while your lord and brother is perhaps perishing
      out there! I command you&mdash;go at once and seek him! Do you hear?
    </p>
    <p>
      ORM. Why, what is the matter? You were never before so concerned about
      your mate! You might find time to give me a drink of ale before I go.
    </p>
    <p>
      VALGERD. Warm your knees by the hearth. I shall go&mdash;and defy wind and
      storm.
    </p>
    <p>
      ORM. [Taking her hounds]. Woman, woman&mdash;after all, you are a woman!
    </p>
    <p>
      VALGERD [Angry]. Let go my hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      ORM. Now the Erl is saved!
    </p>
    <p>
      VALGERD. Saved?
    </p>
    <p>
      ORM. Yes, you have been given back to him&mdash;and that is his voice now.
      [Goes.]
    </p>
    <p>
      [Voices of Thorfinn and Orm are heard outside, Thorfinn laughing loudly.]
    </p>
    <p>
      VALGERD. The Erl comes&mdash;he laughs&mdash;that I have never heard
      before&mdash;oh, there is something terrible approaching! [Wrings her
      hands.]
    </p>
    <p>
      [Enter Thorfinn and Orm.]
    </p>
    <p>
      THORFINN [Laughing]. That was a murderous sight&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      ORM. Yes, I promise you!
    </p>
    <p>
      VALGERD. Welcome home, mate.
    </p>
    <p>
      THORFINN. Thanks, wife. Have you been out in the rain? Your eyes are wet.
    </p>
    <p>
      VALGERD. You are so merry!
    </p>
    <p>
      THORFINN. Merry? Yes&mdash;yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      VALGERD. What became of your ships?
    </p>
    <p>
      ORM. They went to the bottom&mdash;all but one.
    </p>
    <p>
      VALGERD [To Thorfinn]. And you can nevertheless be so gay?
    </p>
    <p>
      THORFINN. Ho! Ho! Timber grows in plenty in the north!
    </p>
    <p>
      ORM. Now perhaps we might have something life-giving.
    </p>
    <p>
      THORFINN. Well said! Fetch some ale, wife, and let's be merry.
    </p>
    <p>
      ORM. And we'll thank the gods who saved us.
    </p>
    <p>
      THORFINN. When will you ever outgrow those sagas, Orm?
    </p>
    <p>
      ORM. Why do you force your wife and daughter to believe in them?
    </p>
    <p>
      THORFINN. Women folk should have gods.
    </p>
    <p>
      ORM. Whom do you believe helped you out there in the storm?
    </p>
    <p>
      THORFINN. I helped myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      ORM. And yet you cried out to Ake-Thor when the big wave swallowed you.
    </p>
    <p>
      THORFINN. There you lie.
    </p>
    <p>
      ORM. Orm never lies.
    </p>
    <p>
      THORFINN. Orm is a poet!
    </p>
    <p>
      ORM. Thorfinn must have swallowed too much sea water when he cried for
      help to have such a bitter tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      THORFINN. Take care of your own tongue, Orm.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Valgerd with drinking horns.]
    </p>
    <p>
      VALGERD. Here, foster brothers, I drink to your oath of friendship and
      better luck for your next voyage.
    </p>
    <p>
      THORFINN. I forbid you to speak of that again. [They drink. Thorfinn takes
      horn hastily from mouth and asks] Where is the child?
    </p>
    <p>
      VALGERD [Troubled]. She is in the loft.
    </p>
    <p>
      THORFINN. Call her hither.
    </p>
    <p>
      VALGERD. She's not well.
    </p>
    <p>
      THORFINN [Looks sharply at Valgerd]. She shall&mdash;come!
    </p>
    <p>
      VALGERD. You don't mean that.
    </p>
    <p>
      THORFINN. Did you hear the word?
    </p>
    <p>
      VALGERD. It is not your last.
    </p>
    <p>
      THORFINN. A man has but one, though woman must always have the last.
    </p>
    <p>
      VALGERD [Weakly]. You mock me.
    </p>
    <p>
      THORFINN. You are angry I believe.
    </p>
    <p>
      VALGERD. You laugh so much tonight.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Goes out.]
    </p>
    <p>
      THORFINN. Orm! A thought comes to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      ORM. If it's a great one you had better hide it. Great thoughts are scarce
      these days.
    </p>
    <p>
      THORFINN. Did you notice my wife?
    </p>
    <p>
      ORM. I never notice other men's wives.
    </p>
    <p>
      THORFINN. How kindly and mild she was.
    </p>
    <p>
      ORM. She pitied you.
    </p>
    <p>
      THORFINN. Pitied me?
    </p>
    <p>
      ORM. Yes, because sorrow that laughs is the laughter of death, she
      thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      THORFINN. Woman cannot think.
    </p>
    <p>
      ORM. No, not with her head, but with her heart. That's why she has a
      smaller head but a bigger breast than we.
    </p>
    <p>
      THORFINN. Forebodings of evil torture me.
    </p>
    <p>
      ORM. Poor Thorfinn.
    </p>
    <p>
      THORFINN. My child! Orm! When she comes do you bid her drink from the horn
      to Asa-Odin.
    </p>
    <p>
      ORM. The fox scents against, the wind. I understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      THORFINN. Be ready&mdash;they come.
    </p>
    <p>
      ORM. Be not hard with the child, Thorfinn, or you will have me to reckon
      with.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Valgerd and Gunlöd enter. The latter heavy with sleepiness.]
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNLÖD. Welcome home, father.
    </p>
    <p>
      THORFINN. Do you speak truthfully?
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNLÖD. [Silent.]
    </p>
    <p>
      THORFINN. You are ill, are you not?
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNLÖD. I am not quite myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      THORFINN. I fear so.
    </p>
    <p>
      ORM [Waning a drinking horn over the fire]. Come, Gunlöd, and empty this
      sacred horn to Odin who saved your father from shipwreck.
    </p>
    <p>
      [All empty their horns except Gunlöd.]
    </p>
    <p>
      THORFINN [Tremblingly]. Drink, Gunlöd.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Gunlöd throws the horn on floor and goes to Thorfinn and buries her head
      in his lap.]
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNLÖD. Hear me, father. I am a Christian. Do with me what you will&mdash;my
      soul you cannot destroy. God and the Saints will protect it.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Thorfinn is beside himself with grief and rage. Rises and pushes Gunlöd
      away from him and tries to speak, but words fail him. Sits on his high
      bench again in silence. Orm goes to the women and speaks quietly to them.
      They go toward door. Suddenly Gunlöd turns.]
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNLÖD. No! I won't go. I must speak that you, my father, may not go to
      the grave with a lie&mdash;for your whole life has been a lie! I shall
      sacrifice the child's respect&mdash;love I have never felt&mdash;and prove
      to you what terrible guilt you have gathered on your head. Know then, you
      have taught me to hate&mdash;for when did you ever give me love&mdash;you
      taught me to fear the great Erl Thorfinn and you have succeeded, because I
      tremble before your harshness. I respect your many scars and great deeds,
      but you never taught me to love my father. You always thrust me away when
      I wanted to come to you&mdash;you poisoned my soul and now you see God's
      punishment. You have made me a criminal&mdash;for such I am at this
      moment, but it cannot be otherwise. Why do you hate my belief? Because it
      is love and yours is hate! Oh, father, father, I want to kiss the clouds
      from your brow. I wanted to caress your white locks and make you forget
      the sorrows that whitened them. I wanted to support you when your steps
      began to falter&mdash;Oh! forget what I have said&mdash;open your arms
      [falls on her knees] and take me to your heart. Look at me tenderly&mdash;just
      once before it is too late. Speak one word&mdash;[springs to her feet] Oh,
      your glance freezes me! You will not! I shall pray for power to love you.
      [Bursts into tears and goes out, followed by Valgerd, Orm goes forward to
      Thorfinn.]
    </p>
    <p>
      THORFINN. Sing for me, Orm.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      THORFINN. Lie then.

      ORM. Never mind. You shall hear more from me later.
    </p>
    <p>
      THORFINN. Orm, you are my friend!
    </p>
    <p>
      ORM. H'm&mdash;of course!
    </p>
    <p>
      THORFINN. I lack peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      ORM. There are two ways to gain peace: one is never to do anything one
      regrets&mdash;the other never to regret anything one does!
    </p>
    <p>
      THORFINN. But if one has already done what one regrets?
    </p>
    <p>
      ORM. Thorfinn! That is to say, you regret your harshness toward your
      child?
    </p>
    <p>
      THORFINN [Angry]. I regret nothing. And as far as the child is concerned
      you had better hold your tongue!
    </p>
    <p>
      ORM. Hear you, Thorfinn&mdash;have you ever thought about what your life
      has been?
    </p>
    <p>
      THORFINN. Thinking is for old women&mdash;doing has been my life.
    </p>
    <p>
      ORM. What do you intend to do now?
    </p>
    <p>
      THORFINN. What do I intend to do now?
    </p>
    <p>
      ORM. Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      THORFINN [Shaken, is silent.]
    </p>
    <p>
      ORM. You see how even a little thought struck you&mdash;think then if a
      big thought should come. Why don't you dare to look back? Because you are
      afraid of the sights you would see.
    </p>
    <p>
      THORFINN. Let the past remain buried.
    </p>
    <p>
      ORM. No, I shall tear the corpses from their graves and they shall stare
      at you with their empty orbits until you quake with anguish and fear&mdash;and
      you shall see that with all your strength you were not a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      THORFINN. What are you saying, madman?
    </p>
    <p>
      ORM. Yes, shout&mdash;you are still a boy. Yes, you&mdash;I have seen big,
      tall children with bushy beards and gray hairs and crooked backs as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      THORFINN. Hold your tongue, Orm.
    </p>
    <p>
      ORM. Shout until the hut trembles&mdash;the truth you cannot shout down.
    </p>
    <p>
      THORFINN. Silence, before I strike you!
    </p>
    <p>
      ORM. Strike! Strike me to death&mdash;tear the tongue out of my mouth&mdash;with
      copper trumpets shall the truth be blasted into your ears, "Your life has
      been a lie."
    </p>
    <p>
      THORFINN [With repressed anger and pain]. Orm, I beg of you&mdash;speak no
      more.
    </p>
    <p>
      ORM. Yes, Thorfinn, I shall speak. Feel how the earth trembles under you.
      That means an earthquake! The whole earth trembles these days, for she is
      about to give birth. She is to bring forth in dire pain a glorious hero.
      Open your eyes and look. Do you see how the east wars with the west? It is
      love's first conflict&mdash;the new bride trembles under the elder's
      embraces, she struggles and suffers&mdash;but soon she shall rejoice, and
      thousands of torches shall be lighted and radiate peace and gladness,
      because he shall be born, the young, the strong, the beautiful princeling,
      who shall rule over all peoples and whose sceptre is called love and whose
      crown is called light and whose name is the new age! Thorfinn! do you
      remember the saga about Thor at Utgorda Loake? He lifted the cat so high
      that the trolls turned pale; he drank so deep from the horn that the
      trolls trembled&mdash;but when the old woman felled him to his knees then
      the trolls laughed. It was the age that vanquished him, and it is the age
      that you have warred against, and which has slain you&mdash;it is the lord
      of the age, it is God who has crushed you.
    </p>
    <p>
      THORFINN. I have never known any god but my own strength, and that god I
      believe in!
    </p>
    <p>
      ORM. You don't know him&mdash;you who have so long been lying at feud with
      him. It was he who drove you from your native land, and you thought you
      were escaping him. It was he who struck your ships to splinters and
      swallowed up your treasures and ended your power. It was he who tore your
      child from you&mdash;and you said you lacked peace! It was he&mdash;[Messenger
      enters.]
    </p>
    <p>
      MESSENGER. Are you the Erl Thorfinn.
    </p>
    <p>
      THORFINN. I am.
    </p>
    <p>
      MESSENGER. You committed the coast massacre at Reyd-fiord last spring?
    </p>
    <p>
      THORFINN [Undisturbed]. I did.
    </p>
    <p>
      MESSENGER. You plundered and burned Hallfred at Thorvalla?
    </p>
    <p>
      THORFINN. Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      MESSENGER. And then you disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      THORFINN [Silent.]
    </p>
    <p>
      MESSENGER. The Allting has now declared you an outlaw and pronounced you a
      felon. Your house is to be burned to the ground, and whomsoever will may
      take your life. Your enemies are at hand, therefore fly while there is yet
      time&mdash;make your escape this night.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Messenger goes out and there is a long pause.]
    </p>
    <p>
      ORM. Do you know who that was?
    </p>
    <p>
      THORFINN. You may well ask that.
    </p>
    <p>
      ORM. It&mdash;was a messenger from that old woman who felled Thor&mdash;the
      age!
    </p>
    <p>
      THORFINN. You talk like an old woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      ORM. This age does not want to use force, but you have violated it and it
      strikes you.
    </p>
    <p>
      THORFINN. This age cannot suffer strength, therefore it worships weakness.
    </p>
    <p>
      ORM. When you came to this island you swore peace. You have broken your
      oath, you have violated your honor, therefore you must die like a felon.
    </p>
    <p>
      THORFINN. Do you too call me a felon?
    </p>
    <p>
      ORM. Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      THORFINN. Would you dare to break an oath? Would you dare to in called a
      felon?
    </p>
    <p>
      ORM [Silent.]
    </p>
    <p>
      THORFINN. Poor wretch! It is you who put shackles on me when I want to
      fly! Like a snake you coil yourself around my legs. Let go of me!
    </p>
    <p>
      ORM. We have sworn the oath of foster-brothers.
    </p>
    <p>
      THORFINN. I break it!
    </p>
    <p>
      ORM. You cannot.
    </p>
    <p>
      THORFINN. Then I'll kick you out of the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      ORM. That will be our death.
    </p>
    <p>
      THORFINN. Are you a man, Orm?
    </p>
    <p>
      ORM. I've become a poet only.
    </p>
    <p>
      THORFINN. Therefore you have become nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      ORM. I knew what I wanted, but I could not attain it. You could attain
      anything, but did not know what you wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      THORFINN. Thanks for your song. Farewell.
    </p>
    <p>
      ORM. Who will sing your death song?
    </p>
    <p>
      THORFINN. The ravens no doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
      ORM. Do you dare to die, Thorfinn?
    </p>
    <p>
      THORFINN. I dare more! I dare to be forgotten!
    </p>
    <p>
      ORM. You were always stronger than I. Farewell. We'll meet again. [Orm
      goes out.]
    </p>
    <p>
      THORFINN. Alone! Alone! Alone! [Pause.] I remember one autumn when the
      equinoctial storm raged over England's sun my dragon ship was wrecked and
      I was tossed up on the rocks alone. Afterward everything grew calm. Oh,
      what long days and nights! Only the cloudless sky above and endlessly the
      deep blue sea around me. Not a sound of any living creature! Not even the
      gulls to wake me with their screeching! Not even a breeze stirred the
      waves to lap against the stones. It seemed as if I myself were dead!
      Loudly I talked and shouted, but the sound of my voice frightened me, and
      thirst bound my tongue. Only the even beat of my heart in my breast told
      me that I was alive! But after a moment's listening I heard it no longer
      and, trembling, I rose to my feet, and so it was each time until,
      senseless, I swooned. When at last I revived I heard the slow beats of a
      heart beside me and a deep breathing that was not mine, and courage
      revived in my soul. I looked about&mdash;it was a seal seeking rest; it
      gazed at me with its moist eyes as if filled with compassion for me. Now I
      was no longer alone! I stretched out my hand to caress its rough body;
      then it fled and I was doubly alone. Again I am on the rocks! What do I
      fear? Yes, loneliness! What is loneliness? It is I, myself! Who am I then
      to fear myself? Am I not Erl Thorfinn, the strong, who has bowed thousands
      of wills to his? Who never asked for friendship or love but himself bore
      his own sorrows! No! No! I am another! And therefore Thorfinn the strong
      fears Thorfinn the weak! Who stole my strength? Who struck me down? Was it
      the sea? Have I not vanquished the sea three times ten voyages? And it,
      has defeated me but once&mdash;but then to the death! It was the stronger.
      It was a God. But who subdued the sea that lately raged? Who? Who? Who? It
      was the stronger! Who are you then, the stronger! Oh, answer, that I may
      believe! He does not answer!&mdash;All is silent!&mdash;Again I hear my
      heart beating. Oh, help, help! I am cold, I freeze&mdash;[Goes to door and
      calls Valgerd.]
    </p>
    <p>
      [Enter a thrall.]
    </p>
    <p>
      THRALL. You called, Master Erl?
    </p>
    <p>
      THORFINN [Recovering himself]. You were mistaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      THRALL. Yes, master.
    </p>
    <p>
      THORFINN. How many men are we?
    </p>
    <p>
      THRALL. Oh&mdash;half three score I think.
    </p>
    <p>
      THORFINN. Are you afraid to die, thrall?
    </p>
    <p>
      THRALL. How can I be when I believe that I shall be saved?
    </p>
    <p>
      [Crosses himself.]
    </p>
    <p>
      THORFINN. What does that mean?
    </p>
    <p>
      THRALL. The bishop has taught us to do that.
    </p>
    <p>
      THORFINN. I forgot that you are a Christian.
    </p>
    <p>
      THRALL. Do you wish me to stay in your service when you are a heathen?
    </p>
    <p>
      THORFINN. I want to prove how little I respect their belief. We must put
      double bolts on the north gate!
    </p>
    <p>
      THRALL. Yes, Master, but the belief is stronger than a hundred bolts.
    </p>
    <p>
      THORFINN. Who questioned you? [Pause.] What happened when you became
      Christians here on the island?
    </p>
    <p>
      THRALL. Oh, it was easier than any one would think. They only poured water
      on us and the bishop read from a big book and then they gave us each a
      white shirt.
    </p>
    <p>
      THORFINN. Tell the twelve strongest to take their new axes&mdash;do you
      hear?
    </p>
    <p>
      THRALL [Starting to go]. Yes, Master.
    </p>
    <p>
      THORFINN. Wait. [Pause.] Do you remember what was written in that big
      book?
    </p>
    <p>
      THRALL. I don't remember much of it, but there was something about two
      thieves who were hanged on crosses along with the Son of God. But one of
      them went to heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      THORFINN. Did they pour water on him, too?
    </p>
    <p>
      THRALL. The bishop didn't say.
    </p>
    <p>
      THORFINN. Do you know whether there are any horses in the stable?
    </p>
    <p>
      THRALL. They must be out at pasture&mdash;but I'll see. [Starts to go.]
    </p>
    <p>
      THORFINN. You mustn't leave me&mdash;Stay. [Pause.] Could you die in peace
      this night?
    </p>
    <p>
      THRALL. Yes, if I only had time for a prayer first.
    </p>
    <p>
      THORFINN. Does that bring peace to one?
    </p>
    <p>
      THRALL. Oh, yes, Master.
    </p>
    <p>
      THORFINN [Rises, takes up a goblet]. This you shall have if you will pray
      for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      THRALL. That's not enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      THORFINN. You shall have ten, but if you ever tell of it&mdash;I'll take
      your life.
    </p>
    <p>
      THRALL. It would not help even if you gave me a hundred. You must pray
      yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
      THORFINN. I cannot, but I command you to pray.
    </p>
    <p>
      THRALL. I will obey&mdash;but you will see that it does not help.
      [Praying.] Jesus Christ, have pity on this poor sinner who begs for mercy.
    </p>
    <p>
      THORFINN. That's a lie. I never begged for anything!
    </p>
    <p>
      THRALL. You see now that it doesn't help.
    </p>
    <p>
      THORFINN. Give me my armor and help me buckle.
    </p>
    <p>
      THRALL [Helping]. You are not keeping still. I can't fasten the buckles.
    </p>
    <p>
      THORFINN. Wretch!
    </p>
    <p>
      THRALL. But your whole body is shaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      THORFINN. That's a lie!
    </p>
    <p>
      [Valgerd and Gunlöd enter.]
    </p>
    <p>
      THRALL. May I go now?
    </p>
    <p>
      THORFINN. Go.
    </p>
    <p>
      VALGERD [Coming forward]. You called me.
    </p>
    <p>
      THORFINN. That's not true.
    </p>
    <p>
      VALGERD. Your enemies are upon you.
    </p>
    <p>
      THORFINN. What does that concern you?
    </p>
    <p>
      VALGRED. Make ready. I have heard what has come to pass.
    </p>
    <p>
      THORFINN. Then it is best that you [indicating both Valgerd and Gunlöd]
      hide yourselves in the cellar passage.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Another messenger enters.]
    </p>
    <p>
      MESSENGER. Erl Thorfinn, we are here. Will you surrender to our superior
      strength?
    </p>
    <p>
      THORFINN [Silent.]
    </p>
    <p>
      MESSENGER. You do not answer. Let the women go as we shall burn your home.
      [Thorfinn is silent.] Your answer!
    </p>
    <p>
      [Gunlöd who has been standing by the door, comes forward and takes a
      battle axe from wall.]
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNLÖD. I give you your answer! Ill must Erl Thorfinn have brought up his
      daughter and little would his wife have loved him if they should desert
      him now. Here is your answer. [Throws battle axe at messenger's feet.]
    </p>
    <p>
      MESSENGER. You are stronger than I thought, Thorfinn. For your daughter's
      sake you shall have a chance to fall like a hero and not as a felon. Make
      ready for open conflict&mdash;out on the field. [Goes out.]
    </p>
    <p>
      THORFINN [to Valgerd]. Out on you, cowardly, faithless woman, to guard my
      treasure so ill! To make my child mine enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNLÖD. O, my father, am I your enemy?
    </p>
    <p>
      THORFINN. You are a Christian; but it is not too late yet. Will you deny
      the white Christ?
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNLÖD. Never! But I will follow you to death.
    </p>
    <p>
      VALGERD. Thorfinn, you call me cowardly. I can suffer that, but faithless&mdash;there
      you wrong me. I have not loved you as warmly as the southern women are
      said to love, yet have I been faithful to you throughout life and I have
      sworn to go with you in death&mdash;as is the ancient custom. [Opens a
      trap door in floor.] Look, here have I prepared my grave, here would I die
      under these smoky beams that have witnessed my sorrows&mdash;and with
      those [points to the carved images of Thor and Odin on uprights of high
      bench] who guided us here. I want to go with the flames, and in the smoke
      shall my spirit rise to Ginde to receive charity and peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNLÖD. And I to be alone afterward! Oh, let me follow you.
    </p>
    <p>
      VALGERD. No, child, you are young. You may yet flourish in a milder clime.
      But the old fir tree dies on its roots.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNLÖD. Father, father, you must not die. I will save you!
    </p>
    <p>
      THORFINN. You?
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNLÖD. Your kinsman Gunnar lies off Hjärleif's headland with his men.
      Send one of the thralls to him by a roundabout route and he will come.
    </p>
    <p>
      THORFINN. So! It wax out of that well that you drew your courage. Keep
      your help and go if you will.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNLÖD. You shall not think me a coward. I go with you, mother. You cannot
      hinder me.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Thorfinn goes to the door, trying to conceal his emotion.]
    </p>
    <p>
      VALGERD. No! Stay, Thorfinn, and for once bare your big soul that I may
      read its dim runics.
    </p>
    <p>
      THORFINN. If you cannot interpret them now then may this runic stone
      crumble to air unread.
    </p>
    <p>
      VALGERD. You are not the hard stone you would seem. You have feelings.
      Show them. Let them flow forth and you shall know peace!
    </p>
    <p>
      THORFINN. My feelings are my heart's blood. Would you see it?
    </p>
    <p>
      [The clatter of arms is heard outside which continues until Thorfinn
      returns. Thorfinn starts to go out when he hears the chatter.]
    </p>
    <p>
      VALGERD. Oh, stay and say a word of farewell!
    </p>
    <p>
      THORFINN. Woman, you tear down my strength with your feelings. Let me go!
      The play has begun!
    </p>
    <p>
      VALGERD. Say farewell, at least.
    </p>
    <p>
      THORNFINN [Restraining his feelings with effort]. Farewell, child. [Goes
      out.]
    </p>
    <p>
      VALGERD. That man no one will bend.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNLÖD. God will!
    </p>
    <p>
      VALGERD. His hardness is great.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNLÖD. God's mercy is greater!
    </p>
    <p>
      VALGERD. Farewell, my child.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNLÖD. Do you dare leave me behind, alone?
    </p>
    <p>
      VALGERD [Embracing Gunlöd]. Are you prepared?
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNLÖD. The holy virgin prays for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      VALGERD. I trust in the God of love.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNLÖD. And in the mother of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      VALGERD. I know her not.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNLÖD. You must believe in her.
    </p>
    <p>
      VALGERD. My belief is not your belief.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNLÖD [Embracing Valgerd]. Forgive me.
    </p>
    <p>
      VALGERD. Now to your place.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Gunlöd opens the wooden shutter at window-hole and looks out. Valgerd
      takes it torch and places herself by the trap door in floor.]
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNLÖD. The strife is sharp.
    </p>
    <p>
      VALGERD. Do you see the Erl?
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNLÖD. He stands at the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      VALGERD. How fares he?
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNLÖD. Everything falls before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      VALGERD. Does he weary?
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNLÖD. Still is he straight&mdash; &mdash; &mdash;See what terrible
      northern lights.
    </p>
    <p>
      VALGERD. Have many fallen?
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNLÖD. I cannot tell. They are drawing away from the threshing yard. Oh,
      the heavens are red as blood!
    </p>
    <p>
      [Pause.]
    </p>
    <p>
      VALGERD. Speak! What do you see?
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNLÖD [With joy]. The silver falcon!
    </p>
    <p>
      VALGERD. It's an ill-omen.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNLÖD. Father comes.
    </p>
    <p>
      VALGERD. Is he wounded?
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNLÖD. Oh, now he is falling!
    </p>
    <p>
      VALGERD. Close the window-hole and trust in God.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNLÖD. No, not yet. A moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      VALGRED. Are you afraid?
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNLÖD [Going toward door]. No! No!
    </p>
    <p>
      [The sounds of the conflict gradually die away.]
    </p>
    <p>
      THORFINN [Comes in pale and wounded.] Stay!
    </p>
    <p>
      [Valgerd goes towards him. Pause.]
    </p>
    <p>
      THORFINN [On high bench]. Come here.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Valgerd and Gunlöd go to him. Thorfinn caresses Gunlöd's hair, kisses her
      forehead, then presses Valgerd's hand.]
    </p>
    <p>
      THORFINN [Kissing Valgerd]. Now you see my heart's blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Valgerd rises to get torch.]
    </p>
    <p>
      VALGERD. Now is our parting over.
    </p>
    <p>
      THORFINN. Stay and live with your child.
    </p>
    <p>
      VALGERD. My oath!
    </p>
    <p>
      THORFINN. My whole life has been a broken oath and yet I hope&mdash;
      &mdash; &mdash;It is better to live&mdash; &mdash; &mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      [Orm comes in wounded. Stops at door.]
    </p>
    <p>
      ORM. May I come?
    </p>
    <p>
      THORFINN. Come.
    </p>
    <p>
      ORM. Have you found peace now?
    </p>
    <p>
      THORFINN [Caressing the woman]. Soon, soon!
    </p>
    <p>
      ORM. Then we are ready for the journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      THORFINN [Looks at Valgerd and Gunlöd]. Not yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      ORM [Sits on bench]. Hurry if you want company.
    </p>
    <p>
      THORFINN. Orm, are you a Christian?
    </p>
    <p>
      ORM. You may ask indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      THORFINN. What are you then, riddle?
    </p>
    <p>
      ORM. I was everything. I was nothing. I was a poet.
    </p>
    <p>
      THORFINN. Do you believe in anything?
    </p>
    <p>
      ORM. I've come to have a belief.
    </p>
    <p>
      THORFINN. What gave it to you?
    </p>
    <p>
      ORM. Doubt, misfortune, sorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      THORFINN [To Valgerd]. Valgerd, give me your hand, so. Hold fast&mdash;tighter&mdash;you
      must not let go until&mdash;the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Gunnar comes in and stops by door.]
    </p>
    <p>
      THORFINN. Who comes?
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNNAR. You know me!
    </p>
    <p>
      THORFINN. I know your voice, but my eyes see you not.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUNNAR. I am your kinsman, Gunnar.
    </p>
    <p>
      THORFINN [After a pause]. Step forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Gunnar remains where he is, looking questioningly at Gunlöd.]
    </p>
    <p>
      THORFINN. Is he here?
    </p>
    <p>
      [Gunlöd rises, goes with slow steps and bowed head to Gunnar. Takes his
      hand and leads him to Thorfinn. They kneel.]
    </p>
    <p>
      THORFINN [Putting hands on their heads]. Eternal &mdash; &mdash; &mdash;
      Creating &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; God&mdash;[Dies.]
    </p>

      THE STRONGER
    </h2>
    <p>
      CHARACTERS
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     MME. X., an actress, married
     MLLE. Y., an actress, unmarried
     A WAITRESS
</pre>
    <p>
      [SCENE&mdash;The corner of a ladies' cafe. Two little iron tables, a red
      velvet sofa, several chairs. Enter Mme. X., dressed in winter clothes,
      carrying a Japanese basket on her arm.]
    </p>
    <p>
      [MLLE. Y. sits with a half empty beer bottle before her, reading an
      illustrated paper, which she changes later for another.]
    </p>
    <p>
      MME. X. Good afternoon, Amelie. You're sitting here alone on Christmas eve
      like a poor bachelor!
    </p>
    <p>
      MLLE. Y. [Looks up, nods, and resumes her reading.]
    </p>
    <p>
      MME. X. Do you know it really hurts me to see you like this, alone, in a
      cafe, and on Christmas eve, too. It makes me feel as I did one time when I
      saw a bridal party in a Paris restaurant, and the bride sat reading a
      comic paper, while the groom played billiards with the witnesses. Huh,
      thought I, with such a beginning, what will follow, and what will be the
      end? He played billiards on his wedding eve! [Mlle. Y. starts to speak].
      And she read a comic paper, you mean? Well, they are not altogether the
      same thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      [A waitress enters, places a cup of chocolate before Mme. X. and goes
      out.]
    </p>
    <p>
      MME. X. You know what, Amelie! I believe you would have done better to
      have kept him! Do you remember, I was the first to say "Forgive him?" Do
      you remember that? You would be married now and have a home. Remember that
      Christmas when you went out to visit your fiance's parents in the country?
      How you gloried in the happiness of home life and really longed to quit
      the theatre forever? Yes, Amelie dear, home is the best of all, the
      theatre next and children&mdash;well, you don't understand that.
    </p>
    <p>
      MLLE. Y. [Looks up scornfully.]
    </p>
    <p>
      [Mme. X. sips a few spoonfuls out of the cup, then opens her basket and
      shows Christmas presents.]
    </p>
    <p>
      MME. X. Now you shall see what I bought for my piggywigs. [Takes up a
      doll.] Look at this! This is for Lisa, ha! Do you see how she can roll her
      eyes and turn her head, eh? And here is Maja's popgun. [Loads it and
      shoots at Mlle. Y.]
    </p>
    <p>
      MLLE. Y. [Makes a startled gesture.]
    </p>
    <p>
      MME. X. Did I frighten you? Do you think I would like to shoot you, eh? On
      my soul, if I don't think you did! If you wanted to shoot <i>me</i> it
      wouldn't be so surprising, because I stood in your way&mdash;and I know
      you can never forget that&mdash;although I was absolutely innocent. You
      still believe I intrigued and got you out of the Stora theatre, but I
      didn't. I didn't do that, although you think so. Well, it doesn't make any
      difference what I say to you. You still believe I did it. [Takes up a pair
      of embroidered slippers.] And these are for my better half. I embroidered
      them myself&mdash;I can't bear tulips, but he wants tulips on everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      MLLE. Y. [Looks up ironically and curiously.]
    </p>
    <p>
      MME. X. [Putting a hand in each slipper.] What little feet Bob has! What?
      And you should see what a splendid stride he has! You've never seen him in
      slippers! [Mlle. Y. laughs aloud.] Look! [She makes the slippers walk on
      the table. Mlle. Y. laughs loudly.] And when he is grumpy he stamps like
      this with his foot. "What! damn those servants who can never learn to make
      coffee. Oh, now those creatures haven't trimmed the lamp wick properly!"
      And then there are draughts on the floor and his feet are cold. "Ugh, how
      cold it is; the stupid idiots can never keep the fire going." [She rubs
      the slippers together, one sole over the other.]
    </p>
    <p>
      MLLE. Y. [Shrieks with laughter.]
    </p>
    <p>
      MME. X. And then he comes home and has to hunt for his slippers which
      Marie has stuck under the chiffonier&mdash;oh, but it's sinful to sit here
      and make fun of one's husband this way when he is kind and a good little
      man. You ought to have had such a husband, Amelie. What are you laughing
      at? What? What? And you see he's true to me. Yes, I'm sure of that,
      because he told me himself&mdash;what are you laughing at?&mdash;that when
      I was touring in Norway that that brazen Frêdêrique came and wanted to
      seduce him! Can you fancy anything so infamous? [Pause.] I'd have torn her
      eyes out if she had come to see him when I was at home. [Pause.] It was
      lucky that Bob told me about it himself and that it didn't reach me
      through gossip. [Pause.] But would you believe it, Frêdêrique wasn't the
      only one! I don't know why, but the women are crazy about my husband. They
      must think he has influence about getting them theatrical engagements,
      because he is connected with the government. Perhaps you were after him
      yourself. I didn't use to trust you any too much. But now I know he never
      bothered his head about you, and you always seemed to have a grudge
      against him someway.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Pause. They look at each other in a puzzled way.]
    </p>
    <p>
      MME. X. Come and see us this evening, Amelie, and show us that you're not
      put out with us,&mdash;not put out with me at any rate. I don't know, but
      I think it would be uncomfortable to have you for an enemy. Perhaps it's
      because I stood in your way [rallentando] or&mdash;I really&mdash;don't
      know why&mdash;in particular.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Pause. Mlle. Y. stares at Mme. X curiously.]
    </p>
    <p>
      MME. X [Thoughtfully]. Our acquaintance has been so queer. When I saw you
      for the first time I was afraid of you, so afraid that I didn't dare let
      you out of my sight; no matter when or where, I always found myself near
      you&mdash;I didn't dare have you for an enemy, so I became your friend.
      But there was always discord when you came to our house, because I saw
      that my husband couldn't endure you, and the whole thing seemed as awry to
      me as an ill-fitting gown&mdash;and I did all I could to make him friendly
      toward you, but with no success until you became engaged. Then came a
      violent friendship between you, so that it looked all at once as though
      you both dared show your real feelings only when you were secure&mdash;and
      then&mdash;how was it later? I didn't get jealous&mdash;strange to say!
      And I remember at the christening, when you acted as godmother, I made him
      kiss you&mdash;he did so, and you became so confused&mdash;as it were; I
      didn't notice it then&mdash;didn't think about it later, either&mdash;have
      never thought about it until&mdash;now! [Rises suddenly.] Why are you
      silent? You haven't said a word this whole time, but you have let me go on
      talking! You have sat there, and your eyes have reeled out of me all these
      thoughts which lay like raw silk in its cocoon&mdash;thoughts&mdash;suspicious
      thoughts, perhaps. Let me see&mdash;why did you break your engagement? Why
      do you never come to our house any more? Why won't you come to see us
      tonight?
    </p>
    <p>
      [Mlle. Y. appears as if about to speak.]
    </p>
    <p>
      MME. X. Hush, you needn't speak&mdash;I understand it all! It was because&mdash;and
      because&mdash;and because! Yes, yes! Now all the accounts balance. That's
      it. Fie, I won't sit at the same table with you. [Moves her things to
      another table.] That's the reason I had to embroider tulips&mdash;which I
      hate&mdash;on his slippers, because you are fond of tulips; that's why
      [Throws slippers on the floor] we go to Lake Mälarn in the summer, because
      you don't like salt water; that's why my boy is named Eskil&mdash;because
      it's your father's name; that's why I wear your colors, read your authors,
      eat your favorite dishes, drink your drinks&mdash;chocolate, for instance;
      that's why&mdash;oh&mdash;my God&mdash;it's terrible, when I think about
      it; it's terrible. Everything, everything came from you to me, even your
      passions. Your soul crept into mine, like a worm into an apple, ate and
      ate, bored and bored, until nothing was left but the rind and a little
      black dust within. I wanted to get away from you, but I couldn't; you lay
      like a snake and charmed me with your black eyes; I felt that when I
      lifted my wings they only dragged me down; I lay in the water with bound
      feet, and the stronger I strove to keep up the deeper I worked myself
      down, down, until I sank to the bottom, where you lay like a giant crab to
      clutch me in your claws&mdash;and there I am lying now.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hate you, hate you, hate you! And you only sit there silent&mdash;silent
      and indifferent; indifferent whether it's new moon or waning moon,
      Christmas or New Year's, whether others are happy or unhappy; without
      power to hate or to love; as quiet as a stork by a rat hole&mdash;you
      couldn't scent your prey and capture it, but you could lie in wait for it!
      You sit here in your corner of the cafê&mdash;did you know it's called
      "The Rat Trap" for you?&mdash;and read the papers to see if misfortune
      hasn't befallen some one, to see if some one hasn't been given notice at
      the theatre, perhaps; you sit here and calculate about your next victim
      and reckon on your chances of recompense like a pilot in a shipwreck. Poor
      Amelie, I pity you, nevertheless, because I know you are unhappy, unhappy
      like one who has been wounded, and angry because you are wounded. I can't
      be angry with you, no matter how much I want to be&mdash;because you come
      out the weaker one. Yes, all that with Bob doesn't trouble me. What is
      that to me, after all? And what difference does it make whether I learned
      to drink chocolate from you or some one else. [Sips a spoonful from her
      cup.]
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides, chocolate is very healthful. And if you taught me how to dress&mdash;tant
      mieux!&mdash;that has only made me more attractive to my husband; so you
      lost and I won there. Well, judging by certain signs, I believe you have
      already lost him; and you certainly intended that I should leave him&mdash;do
      as you did with your fiancê and regret as you now regret; but, you see, I
      don't do that&mdash;we mustn't be too exacting. And why should I take only
      what no one else wants?
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps, take it all in all, I am at this moment the stronger one. You
      received nothing from me, but you gave me much. And now I seem like a
      thief since you have awakened and find I possess what is your loss. How
      could it be otherwise when everything is worthless and sterile in your
      hands? You can never keep a man's love with your tulips and your passions&mdash;but
      I can keep it. You can't learn how to live from your authors, as I have
      learned. You have no little Eskil to cherish, even if your father's name
      was Eskil. And why are you always silent, silent, silent? I thought that
      was strength, but perhaps it is because you have nothing to say! Because
      you never think about anything! [Rises and picks up slippers.]
    </p>
    <p>
      Now I'm going home&mdash;and take the tulips with me&mdash;<i>your</i>
      tulips! You are unable to learn from another; you can't bend&mdash;therefore,
      you broke like a dry stalk. But I won't break! Thank you, Amelie, for all
      your good lessons. Thanks for teaching my husband how to love. Now I'm
      going home to love him. [Goes.]

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
